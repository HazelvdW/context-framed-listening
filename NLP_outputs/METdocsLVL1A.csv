2,bar ,80s,80s_MED_08,BAR-80s_MED_08,BAR_80s,i think about an old 80s that takes place in a i think about a couple dancing and having a good time this brings feelings of nostalgia and good times endofasubhere sounds like a but particularly the outdoor seating area everyone is having cocktails or wine and its a warm evening with a slight breeze cobblestone streets endofasubhere i had to imagine something for this one because nothing was coming to me at first i thought about a gathering like a party but a more organized one like a company party where everyone is just sitting around in their own groups and eating some good food endofasubhere a peaceful somber scene with a bunch of friends hanging out in the afternoon endofasubhere like a performing in a endofasubhere this sounded like something you would hear in a classical diner as well immediately i go back to my early 20s when my friends and i would go to a dennys at 2 in the morning and hear this kind of they would have the jukebox and you could go and pay to have other played it was always great when this style of was on endofasubhere people dancing on the dance floor casually endofasubhere the sound is great and me thought of dancing in a party endofasubhere it absolutely screamed old sitcom introduction to me it gave me a bit of a chuckle right down to the synth strings it had all the instrumentation endofasubhere thoughts of kids watching their favourite show from the television endofasubhere it immediately made me think of children entertainment at somewhere like butlins where they put on entertainment for the children with masked characters roaming around i imagined a large room with banquet tables children running around interacting with different characters endofasubhere i kind get the feeling this type of is from like an old school teenage kicks where it when some kids go into school endofasubhere i could imagine myself watching a tv show or with my friends or family and seeing a scene with similar endofasubhere i imagined the opening credits to a comedy tv show from the 80s with each character of the show getting introduced one by one and this in the back as it shows all the characters endofasubhere it makes me think of being at a parade with balloons floating endofasubhere i imagine that its a retro night hence why they are this maybe a lot of old people have attended this one and everyone seems to be having a good time with retro decoration all around endofasubhere i saw the barkeep having glasses and other things thrown at them for subjecting people to this crap endofasubhere a chill talking for elderly endofasubhere scenes of enjoying the beach with drinks a clown juggling endofasubhere made me think of 80s and comedies again club from america and the fun parties endofasubhere it reminded me of being in kindergarten the is not the same but we had to do those activities where there was a boombox we had to keep walking until the stops and then sit down endofasubhere i was sat in a with my friend and had a drink in front of me the was from a small in the corner and i was sat listening along to it endofasubhere my sister who loves with this beat endofasubhere this was interesting imagined myself dancing in a with a beautiful lady holding each other closely endofasubhere the is a county it is very enjoyable endofasubhere people in a saxophones endofasubhere i pictured this being played in a with people dancing to it i think the demographic in the is slightly older and mostly female and i kind of thought of duke silver as the musician endofasubhere i imagined this being something theyd back in the 1970s 1908s in endofasubhere a scene that is a by the beach in summer endofasubhere 
3,bar ,80s,80s_MED_13,BAR-80s_MED_13,BAR_80s,i could only think about sitting on the couch as a kid and this would be the type of the would during the credits of an old vhs endofasubhere it sounded like perfect for an introduction into a or it was cool and somber endofasubhere this gave me a disco 80s vibe i imagined vibrant colors and afros endofasubhere a setting not much more came to my mind apart from that endofasubhere sounds like made for a staged performance mostly accompanied with choreography i think i have heard such kind of on america and british got talent endofasubhere the first thing i remembered was a super mario when i was younger then i thought about michael jackson endofasubhere a strange 90s where the artists are dressed in white fluffy jackets endofasubhere this strangely made me think of old 80s introduction to love comedies it was just so joyous and cheesy it fits that vibe perfect endofasubhere immediately i imagined a scene from jim henson labyrinth i could not imagine this in a it was a very romantic style as if someone was falling in love with a beautiful girl endofasubhere been played in a and sparking the relationship between couples endofasubhere the seems to be played in occasional events like wedding endofasubhere refreshed and at ease endofasubhere this sounds like the main menu theme for a japanese i can imagine myself loading the and getting a drink to prepare for my gaming session and this can be heard from my tv while i am doing so endofasubhere listening to it in my room endofasubhere it reminded me of the sound of starting your computer up in the early 2000s not sure if its the same endofasubhere i thought of the wonderful christmastime by tuxedo at first the had a vaguely oriental sound to it and i briefly imagined that it might be the introduction to a like enter the dragon endofasubhere i was imagining the ambience in the with the sound endofasubhere i definitely did not imagine a but i did envision watching one of the early 2000s educational science in elementary school it felt magical and nostalgic endofasubhere people in a with slow dancing moves which involves two by two dancing endofasubhere it just sound techno endofasubhere thought of endofasubhere at first it felt like i was watching the opening credits of a then it just felt like listening to soul endofasubhere the start of it the first few seconds make me think of the start of the disney theme tune so something magical endofasubhere i was thinking that this could at an upscale initially with the delicate that was initially maybe at a place with a low stage and a with seating around it later as the vocals came in i thought it could really set the mood for a scene in some fiction where two characters meet for the first time endofasubhere it sounds like a that might be from a small jukebox in the corner of a dark where there arent too many people i could imagine myself sitting in a booth enjoying a drink endofasubhere 
4,bar ,Ele,Ele_LOW_09,BAR-Ele_LOW_09,BAR_Ele,this made me think about europe or a specific country where electric is popular i thought about an outside where people are jumping up and down endofasubhere dark room with some strobe lighting and a dance floor with a dj sitting behind it theres a lot of people and its really crowded everyone is drinking or sitting next to the endofasubhere this one made me smile made me think about riding my motorcycle around night city in cyberpunk 2077 i am sorry if i use gaming a lot in my references but i do a lot but this one made me think about how beautiful that was and how i would love for them to release a sequel endofasubhere this felt like a compilation of on an advertisement that would show off a streaming platform of some sort just a generic fast paced that allows the to go from to of action fast endofasubhere cyberpunk tron racetrack endofasubhere it felt like the background for an adventure which is showing a montage of an adventurous scene endofasubhere this is the most common that i listen to when i work out i instantly start thinking of when i am doing cardio and syncing the time that i start to speed up to the bass drop like this makes me want to keep going even when i am tired which is why i love it so much endofasubhere the dj bringing everyone to start dancing endofasubhere i felt really energetic while listening endofasubhere thoughts of a big stadium full of people while the audio is being released endofasubhere it sounded to me like from a something futuristic like tron and the suspense built while i imagined fighting off robots in a futuristic setting endofasubhere to me this is either an add on a tv a sports car advert or something like a racing event like the f1 endofasubhere it seemed like something that would in a nightclub or in my headphones if i were listening to endofasubhere i imagined a car lining up with a lot of other cars getting ready for a race then going once the race starts and going very fast beating all the other cars endofasubhere this would be heard at a techno where i imagine the would be very loud large crowds around the with everyone wanting to get the bartenders attentions endofasubhere sounds like the kind of tech companies when announcing a new phone endofasubhere battle background or specifically the background of the arena in a gacha endofasubhere it felt like a fight scene was about to happen or a high speed car chase it sounds like something you would hear in the fast and the furious endofasubhere made me think of those where it is 3d and you can kill little characters they are fun and a lot of the i played growing up as well endofasubhere when the first note appeared it reminded me of racing like forza i imagine controlling the car while the gets all hyped up i am making actions like swerving the car and drifting like it is one of those fast and furious endofasubhere it was a very hyper soundtrack so it made me think about my trips at the and how vibrant it was there too endofasubhere i imagined a because the was dance hall sort of and thought of many people dancing with joy endofasubhere it made me think of some sort of cyberpunk heist scene like gearing up for a heist other than that not much endofasubhere this is a really odd now that i am thinking about it not many of these have matched the context given endofasubhere the is giving club vibes endofasubhere at first i thought this was in a but when i listened i imagined a techno style festival where there were strobe lights endofasubhere i imagined myself hearing this kind of in a night club endofasubhere 
5,bar ,Ele,Ele_LOW_14,BAR-Ele_LOW_14,BAR_Ele,feels very busy like i am driving around doing something important something is happening going on or i have a task i need to do urgently endofasubhere makes me think of those gaming where you drink and they have old consoles like pac man etc or in a 70s 80s 90s themed endofasubhere i imagined being in rave with several led and strobe lights everyones having fun and dancing around with a partner endofasubhere this feels like it was just ripped straight from a level in shovel knight dunno which though never beat it myself if you this in a theyll laugh you straight out endofasubhere that was entirely from an old like mega man or something like that endofasubhere it sounded like classic endofasubhere a scene were theres a party at the after a victory endofasubhere having it rough and tough in life experiencing a stressful period in your life and just feeling so worn out sometimes endofasubhere it has a nice laidback vibe the kind of you could listen while hanging out with friends on a summer evening endofasubhere i imagine we are dat with my friends in the and this its my favorite so i stand up and dance endofasubhere i felt entertained by the tune endofasubhere sounds from a pac man arcade machine endofasubhere i thought i was in a club dancing with a partner the was being played by a dj late in the night endofasubhere i was imagining a retro kind of like snake endofasubhere geometry dash again and then this other similar that takes place in space i believe its called run or rush but i was just imagining what the screen looks like when you those endofasubhere this brought back memories of me at rave with my friends early hours of the morning all sweaty dancing our socks off laser lights going off fun times endofasubhere a bunch of little aliens performing a tech endofasubhere i imagined an outdoor rave with people dancing lights flashing fireworks being set off in the background some people sitting and eating food the atmosphere is lively its nighttime endofasubhere when i heard this i thought about being at a edm event and the about to drop to the next phase of the endofasubhere its not as heavy as ibiza dance its more like an edm festival so for a setting i simply envisioned a very bright and perhaps early evening but a late sunrise so perhaps middle of summer or late summer the people are old and young as the is not a certain demographic and has 8 or 2 to 4 bit remedies so can be nostalgic for a middle aged crowd as well as modern and up to date for younger crowds for some reason it reminded me of gaming too and specifically minecraft so can apply to this demographic possibly too endofasubhere bring memories of hangouts with friends endofasubhere i imagined being in a dark crowded club with flashing lights dancing to the rhythms and beats pulsing through my body endofasubhere retro platformers maybe boss levels endofasubhere i could imagine this in a 2nd pixel with the main character finally getting to the last boss of the after so many hard trials endofasubhere people listen to electropop at the festival dj would drop the beat endofasubhere in a drunk and dancing uncontrollably endofasubhere sounds like to me the beginning of a classic 80s 90s house proper great nostalgic feeling that comes with it makes you want to dance endofasubhere mario endofasubhere i imagined people dancing at techno raves having a good time and jumping around i also imagined whooshing fireworks and arcade being played endofasubhere it was too loud i was wondering when it will end endofasubhere 8 bit frog jumping around in some psychedelic 90s style playstation endofasubhere a futuristic where people have many cybernetic augmentations taking foreign drugs endofasubhere i think this fits more endofasubhere i pictured a weird sort of and arcade combo a place where you can buy food and drink but its also filled with retro arcade machines for you to on lots of neon lights and signs somewhat nerdy and eccentric endofasubhere i could imagine this on a mobile rpg level or something like mario i could not picture this in a at all endofasubhere 
6,bar ,Ele,Ele_MED_19,BAR-Ele_MED_19,BAR_Ele,this felt like i was listening to a lofi beats spotify playlist its quite relaxing endofasubhere a rainy day and a forest endofasubhere i can see myself in a car as a passenger rain rolling down the windows as we drive on the interstate just outside of boston the sky is gloomy and there is so much fog in the sky or is it the clouds its very somber i am moving away from something to start a new life my heart is broken as i am leaving it all behind endofasubhere i was a dim lit with not a ton of people and had a melancholy feel in the beginning endofasubhere i instantly imagined myself sat in a by myself feeling pretty down and then when the beat dropped i imagined locking eyes with someone this feels like meeting someone special for the first time endofasubhere sounded more like the background used by choreographers for instance during a ballet dance endofasubhere the sounds reminds me of prom night with my ex boyfriend the memory endofasubhere the first part did not remind me of much but when the beat came i started to think about when i was clubbing in my first week of university with friends i had just met the beat brought me back to the club endofasubhere i imagined myself sitting in a brunch drinking a milkshake and waiting for a grilled sandwich the was somewhat dark in colour trendy endofasubhere this was wildly similar to minecraft i would think it was if heard in makes me feel relaxed and nice endofasubhere with just the chords at the beginning i pictured someone sad looking out the window of a car crying but when the beat kicked in i could not really picture anything endofasubhere an advertisement of a real estate company prompting viewers about the list of available houses and payment techniques endofasubhere i saw a guy sitting at a in a black leather jacket drinking a beer endofasubhere i thought the sounded almost sad and contemplative a weird choice for a but then more kicked in and in addition to feeling sad it started feeling active something that is nice to listen to and gentle a good beat that catches the ear but is not too obtrusive as background noise endofasubhere it sounded like twilight endofasubhere one of my favourite i could listen to this anywhere so reminds me of lots of different things but particularly being on a walk or on a train looking at the world go by endofasubhere i have heard the during my camping days endofasubhere i imagined i was watching a i could see a character who was solemn yet determined after experiencing some sort of negative event of a set back of some kind they are in a dimly lit library with a warm undertone the character is reading a book but also has a stern expression as if in deep thought beyond the book itself while they sit at a messy desk that feels cluttered yet cluttered with a purpose endofasubhere it started to sound like something from sad romantic scene but then when the changed i was unsure of this endofasubhere this sounded like it could be placing at the beginning of a set in the 1970s it evoked thoughts of the disco era i was randomly reminded of the sleeping dogs endofasubhere surprisingly this inspired me to imagine some vivid scenes endofasubhere this sounds like the focus on an app i have the keep me focused while working a simple calm and relaxing melody endofasubhere it reminds me of my grandfather endofasubhere i imagined a romance drama with the main character going through life alone after a breakup the scene was dark moody but the tone of the wasnt overly depressing more like a transition between the breakup scene and a more positive scene endofasubhere a where mostly it is attended by rich people and normally drink expensive liquor endofasubhere i imagined spacing out to this npc endofasubhere i imagined a endofasubhere it felt really good to listen i imagined a scene where i was on vacation with my partner in a cozy setting fireplace and good vibes endofasubhere i was thinking that initially i could see this being played a at a small and intimate venue but when the beat and other elements of the kicked in i was visualising this over a set of speakers in a midsized full of younger patrons endofasubhere it sounds like something that would maybe be played during a djs warm up set in a semi empty the would be more modern looking endofasubhere i was really vibing with the first bit and it reminded me of an indie where someone is riding a bus and looking out of the window but they do not quite have the rights to so it is copyright free then it started to almost sound like dubstep and that vision switched to someone making for the first time and just adding things in that might sound good endofasubhere sounds like background while studying or working to keep you focused and improve the mood it gives me laid back but composed vibes endofasubhere

16,concert ,80s,80s_LOW_02,CONCERT-80s_LOW_02,CON_80s,i thought about my dad being in a my dad loved and wherever i hear it i think about him this brought feelings of nostalgia and curiosity endofasubhere i imagined myself walking into an empty church building where the are being tested before church service endofasubhere it did not hit me right away but this made me think of the la noir like a scene where the detective is trying to interview the attractive suspect and she is trying to hide the truth endofasubhere even though there was not one present in the itself i visualised a huge orchestra in the background of a man with a saxophone on a huge stadium like stage the man was lit in limelight and with passion the player was also lit up with smaller stage lighting and there was a lot of mist in the air fog machine the scene featured a lot of blue lighting to make it feel as though the orchestra and sax player are underwater endofasubhere ending of a vintage 80s or 90s on the beach the two characters walk off into the sunset endofasubhere this sounded like introduction to a or i feel like i have heard similar in especially like mafia since that is set in the early 1900s i have also heard like this played in the introduction to a when they are bringing all of the characters in endofasubhere a romantic scene people dancing in each others arms endofasubhere the sound was really soothing and made me imagined it for my pet to sleep endofasubhere i was reminded of when my mom would listen to when i was little things like this would sometimes sounds very close to the 80s stuff endofasubhere thoughts of live when the trumpet is being played and the is so carrying or smooth endofasubhere i imagined a character in a fresh from a break up sitting alone at a darkly lit with a glass of whisky looking melancholy and lost endofasubhere i imagined more of a smaller in a club of sorts lights low and everything endofasubhere i think of a man with short blonde hair sitting at a and it whilst looking like hes really getting into the endofasubhere it made me feel like i was walking through a forest as it was so calming and surreal sounding i could imagine the sun on my face endofasubhere played during a solo act the guy with the saxophone is doing so well that the whole crowd is excited and amazed by how well hes endofasubhere played at a club or a bistro endofasubhere  endofasubhere a sensual romantic scene with two lovers connecting also i can picture the instrumentalists on stage in an opera like setting endofasubhere makes me think of seductive women and those mysterious 50s where they solve crimes as well it is very secretive and fun endofasubhere when i heard the saxophone despite its despondent tone i thought about the saxophone man the dude who appears in eurovision and is quite famous i do not know why he appeared in my thoughts so prominently but he exists and is making the same motions with his own saxophone while being melodramatic endofasubhere i imagined a live performance i was sitting in a big theater and it was completely dark except for the spotlight shining on the performers onstage endofasubhere my previous girlfriend who love rbs and blue endofasubhere i imagined musicians at a cocktail party endofasubhere a sort of lamenting scene late at night kind of misty woman walking around aimlessly with her head hanging low dejected loss or failure as the feeling endofasubhere seems like a relaxing slow type of to calm you down endofasubhere the is relaxing endofasubhere i imagined a set up with golden lights to fit the tune of the saxophone and lots of people swaying and feeling the endofasubhere i imagined a on stage in an intimate venue the audience was sat at small tables drinking wine and cocktails there was ambient warm lighting and the sound of quiet chatter over the endofasubhere i imagined myself being on holiday and hearing a live this maybe as entertainment endofasubhere people in a ballroom in elegant dresses slow dancing on the floor endofasubhere 
17,concert ,80s,80s_LOW_06,CONCERT-80s_LOW_06,CON_80s,very bland like lift or something not something i would specifically think about or remember end credits again endofasubhere middle aged people at the endofasubhere i imagined walking in a clothing store forever 21 charlotte russe etc and hearing this blasting from the speakers endofasubhere it sounded like a bit played in a tv show or a very old not a at all endofasubhere it reminded me of the opening theme tune to the show seinfeld endofasubhere a usually played at a party especially in of the 90s endofasubhere i saw myself having fun at a dancing and enjoying the with friends from school we were having a reunion and just drinking gossiping dancing and everyone seemed happy endofasubhere it makes me think of a high speed car chase through a neon lit city endofasubhere i imagine its on a friday evening and my husband and i decided to go to a and catch up with some friends we find the one we arrive endofasubhere that is pop gives the feeling of having fun sing along and dancing at the same time endofasubhere i picture people in praise place clapping and raising their voice endofasubhere the tune gives a driving experience endofasubhere 1960s 1970s found in a sitcom endofasubhere sounds more like a i have heard in some classical events endofasubhere again i saw a lot of coloured backgrounds changing with the beat a kind of green screened person dancing like in disco style and a trumpet and a bass flying across the colours endofasubhere people dancing on a hot sunny day down the seafront laughing and joking and in their own world endofasubhere a random day in a sunny shopping district endofasubhere i imagined an end of the wedding with everyone from the being there the wedding was a success the couple are very happy and the characters are dancing at the alter everyones cheerful the names of the actors come up when a close up of them dancing comes on the screen endofasubhere free improvisation sort of jam it gave me the thoughts of a local city festival middle of the day middle of the town square road closed for the festival and free to all people of the city and aimlessly but intelligently in terms of the chords but nothing too experimental or extreme this is a good thing as it appeals to a more wider crowd old young and all in between rather than just one or the other endofasubhere reminds me of my last experience endofasubhere i imagined being in a lively dancing and singing along under bright lights endofasubhere city skylines at night smoky clubs new york chicago steamy back alleyways people dancing 70s clubs endofasubhere i could imagine a friend group at a disco nightclub dancing their hearts away after a long day of work endofasubhere people are dancing at the disco people perform the soul train on the stage endofasubhere the final scene in an 80s romantic comedy probably the two main characters finally getting together set in new york of course endofasubhere sitcom theme 80s inspired family comedy endofasubhere dancing like no one else in a endofasubhere very talented can hear all included endofasubhere a solo performance on a 360 stage endofasubhere fun scenes of people dancing in a 70s disco a saxophone player appears and does a solo for the people dancing endofasubhere definitely a sound i have heard it before and it makes you wan na dance or keep dancing endofasubhere happy times in tokyo in the 80s endofasubhere i pictured a stadium sort of place with lots of tiers and people dancing and singing a long to all with happy expressions on their faces endofasubhere i could picture this on a live show more than any type of like a live set or something like that more than a endofasubhere 
18,concert ,80s,80s_MED_08,CONCERT-80s_MED_08,CON_80s,i see a roller rink from the 80s bright colors people are talking and laughing the is loud lights are dark and everything feels alive i can almost feel the air brushing past my face i as i skate around endofasubhere it made me think of something retro mixed with something new age endofasubhere this reminded me of the beginning theme to old school shows where its showing the town and what the different characters are doing in the opening scenes endofasubhere being at a specifically at a madness for some reason maybe because the is similar not much else apart from that endofasubhere sounds like a staged maybe with a live audience endofasubhere the sound reminds me of a scene where a man was walking in a sarcastic manner in the street of new york from a 90s endofasubhere this reminds me of a children parade where cute furry animals would walk along a street with people watching on the sides i recently watched squid it reminded me of the part where the little girl is watching the bunny endofasubhere gareth gates for spirit in the sky the tunes are similar endofasubhere really reminded me of 90s kids shows like hi5 and art attack brightly colour sets with a live audience furniture that looks like giant versions of paint brushes and overly smiley hosts endofasubhere the older generation dancing to the with their partners since it was released in their generation and they love it endofasubhere the reflects a melody in a party or club endofasubhere i imagined people at a beach resort listening to an outdoor laughing and socializing endofasubhere feels like celebration end credits like theres a montage of final events after the story has reached its resolution and things are winding down endofasubhere in my car while on a long road trip it made me feel hopeful and relaxed endofasubhere i am in a retro themed in a city such as new orleans and i can hear this softly in the background amidst the chatter of the customers the vibe is casual and the people arent dressed to match the theme of the but the theme is bold enough to not be affected by this endofasubhere in a party endofasubhere it reminded me of alfresco dining in a busy town endofasubhere i felt that this might be the type of played at a in new orleans i have never heard this before as far as i can recall but one of the made me think of mardi gras and new orleans i could not think of a specific artist who would be this type of the sounded like good background for a celebratory scene in a tv show it evoked vaguely nostalgic feelings endofasubhere reminds me of my graduation day endofasubhere i imagined an upbeat holiday with a compilation of a family laughing mingling and having fun around a large dinner table covered in food endofasubhere i imagined a party endofasubhere i thought about my mum she had tons of records that sounded exactly like this we would listen to these nonstop back then endofasubhere i immediately could see this being an older being performed in a small where the singer was nodding along to the and snapping his fingers ready to croon into the microphone when i was thinking about this i ended up remembering and visualising i have seen of older performances of in black and white which impacted my view of this endofasubhere i imagined this type of to be played as an introduction to a tv show specifically a family themed one maybe from the early 2000s endofasubhere it reminded me of an animated cartoon i was picturing like crocodiles and elephants the with top hats ties and sunglasses on they were swaying to the sound of the it was an older stylized cartoon of like 60s animation endofasubhere sounded like the end credits of a endofasubhere very family friendly sounds like something you would hear in a theme park or in a circus or during a ride in a fair endofasubhere 
19,concert ,80s,80s_MED_13,CONCERT-80s_MED_13,CON_80s,sounds quite magical and whimsical endofasubhere a and entering a new zone area endofasubhere it sounded like an extended version of a 90s console start up sound endofasubhere i imagined an 80s esque abstract at first with a navy blue background fog and cold white blue ambient lighting the last 13th of the seemed fit for a musical but no musical scene came to mind endofasubhere the relates to a circumstance of new romantic relationship endofasubhere love in the hsairits emotionalmakes you want to kiss soomeoehold the person and just cuddleits soothing the endofasubhere i feel like i am at a and the is preparing the crowd for the arrival of the artiste with something calm and interesting endofasubhere that reminded me of my ex boyfriend who loved such types of whenever i visited him at his place those are the kinds of we used to listen to endofasubhere i had happy thoughts listening to the and i felt the thrill of being in a endofasubhere i imagined an introduction for an artist performing a slow at a endofasubhere when i heard the in the context of a i instantly thought of lots of people sat at the o2 arena in manchester which is my only time at a i also thought the sounded a bit like mystery like it was almost like a comedy or magic show rather than a endofasubhere this felt like it was building up tension it made me feel happy and excited endofasubhere my thoughts on this are in a scene where i lacked sleep and i need something to carry me away endofasubhere i imagine a scene where lovers are dancing on the background as is endofasubhere a is on stage the while the singer stands next to him waiting for his or her verse to start so that he can start singing endofasubhere another introduction style to as the are entering the stage people are getting excited there is a bustling among the crowd as the members are entering the stage endofasubhere loading screen or a scene in a where there is a wedding and or they are on their honey moon enjoying being newly weds endofasubhere i felt like i was at home on my bed looking at the ceiling after a long day of work endofasubhere i just saw a girl and it was love at first sight my heart sunk i have butterflies in my stomach and time is moving in slow motion the sun is hitting her face perfectly and it seems like her feet arent even touching the ground endofasubhere a sexual scene between two lovers who are having sex for the first time endofasubhere i imagines a purple and white star rotating in pitch black the star was very bright and shiny with holographic colours reflecting of it endofasubhere stars space other planets endofasubhere i felt like its christmas and i am at the supermarket buying christmas gifts endofasubhere the did not remind me of a but i thought about how it kind of reminded me of an 80s or maybe a soundtrack to a golden age disney like lion king endofasubhere i imagined a very famous celeb ready to begin singing a very calm yet interesting endofasubhere i thought of an old 70s or 80s woman singer on stage about to sing some from that time period wearing neon clothes and volumed hair endofasubhere raindrops falling on the leaves of trees plants in a rainforest endofasubhere i imagined standing in a big crowd at a swaying side to side with everyone else the feels calm and uplifting like one of those moments where you just close your eyes and let the sound wash over you endofasubhere this gave me a type of blues feeling so the feeling of being in a years ago experiencing the older era of endofasubhere 
20,concert ,Ele,Ele_LOW_09,CONCERT-Ele_LOW_09,CON_Ele,i felt like i was at a drum and bass i do not like that or similar like in the and have never had enough energy to enjoy such a so it felt more annoying than emotionally good endofasubhere a festival with strobe lights and a huge crowd endofasubhere i can see a stage and a bunch of people in front of me at an edm people are jumping the room is dark except for the lights from the screen peoples phones the dj and the lasers as the bass builds the lasers start flashing my mind takes a moment hoping no one has undiagnosed epilepsy before endofasubhere it sounded more like club or rave rather than endofasubhere this gave me a feel of an opening at a that is dark with crowds of people getting excited that it finally began endofasubhere being at a rave tightly packed in and surrounded by people lots of light rays from the stage going over the crowd overwhelmed and uncomfortable endofasubhere sounds a background mostly used when anticipating suspense or or a very unexpected event endofasubhere i imagined being in a surrounding that is around water and being around nature the sounds reminds me of past holidays endofasubhere it reminded me a bit about a i used to in my teenage years endofasubhere i imagined a fast paced action which was animated where the main character was running fast and fighting the enemy endofasubhere this one sounded very much in the style of evanescence i thought endofasubhere it really reminded me of tron a dark arena lit by neon blue lights with players getting ready to battle as the track builds i imagined the players running at each other to fight endofasubhere i imagined been at a house party having fun with my freinds also i imagined making new friends at the party and variety of such as truth or dare which would be very fun endofasubhere the birthday celebrations when everyone shows their dancing skills endofasubhere i imagined people in a nightclub with strobe lights going dancing and possibly tripping endofasubhere it feels like action in a science fiction setting the later part of the with sounds that almost remind me of engines roaring can also sound like audience cheers and screams so that is what ties it into the idea for me there is something or someone with the spotlight and this is for them while the audience watches endofasubhere glastonbury rave eurovision endofasubhere i was mesmerised with the as it gave me good feeling endofasubhere i imagined myself sitting in a large arena with thousands of others attending a the is actively taking the stage and this is the build up to their first performance and the crowd is getting hyped up during this endofasubhere a scene in a endofasubhere falling through a time lapse or something along those lines endofasubhere i was vaguely reminded of a that included the words gran turismo in its title i played it in the early 2000s i could not think of much else for this one it seemed to belong to a fast paced action or racing if i had to guess endofasubhere this sound made me imagine the world of cyber punk as this is very similar to the played throughout which is a cyber futuristic style gangster setting endofasubhere reminds me about my favourite team endofasubhere feels like a climax to an explosion or a capture of something the way the beat is building and the tone of the endofasubhere i imagined a scene with teenagers college students partying there were laser lights drinks crowds and people dancing maybe some drugs involved like the indicated one of the characters was feeling euphoric endofasubhere i thought of a endofasubhere i imagined being present at a street dance performance endofasubhere it made me think remember a few raves i have been to such as dreamland and boomtown endofasubhere i really could see this being the extended remix of a really hype that at a kpop or jpop i was really clearly picturing this as the opening for a designed for the idols to show off a complicated dance routine with many backup dancers to create a visual spectacle endofasubhere i pictured a large festival it would be really crowded with thousands of fans taking place during the night endofasubhere there was a crowd and it was at a festival it was night time and there were laser lights pointing in all directions it was very colorful and reminiscent of what Electric Daisy Carnival looks like in my head endofasubhere it reminded me of call of duty main menu theme as if i am waiting in the lobby to multiplayer endofasubhere 
21,concert ,Ele,Ele_LOW_14,CONCERT-Ele_LOW_14,CON_Ele,i thought about an old sonic i thought about the original sonic map and sonic running around i thought about the jumping noise that he makes endofasubhere myself contra its a in my bedroom sitting on the floor with my back against my bed endofasubhere a rave lots of strobe lighting and people jumping up and down its a huge room and its just full of people lit up by the strobe and flashing light endofasubhere when it started i started thinking about the blade but a couple of seconds in it switched to thinking about classic i grew up in a family of gamers so this made me think of a scene from like a boss scene in metroid or the old doom when you just got a power up endofasubhere this sounds like a modern rendition of the old streets of rage with the retro80s feel of the synths and crunchy like drums used it sounds like it would be a perfect menu for an 8bit fighting like that endofasubhere this sound reminded me of from the old sonic the hedgehog this is the kind of you would hear while through the futuristic style levels it was a great representation of that and made me feel like i was the level again endofasubhere i thought of being energized by the sound endofasubhere i envisioned both that try to invoke a retro field and big festivals where they like to endofasubhere i imagined an old school arcade like pac man having this in the background as you are an arcade with a simple and repetitive yet enjoyable premise endofasubhere dj at a getting ready to the big drop after hyping up a crowd with the first section of his endofasubhere i imagined an old 8bit that takes place in space with a space ship and shooting at other targets endofasubhere it makes me imagine dancing with my friends and spinning round in circles with flashing lights endofasubhere sounds the the start of a rave where i can imagine people are starting to get hyped up as the is starting to build up endofasubhere the sounds very disco techno so i imagined a 70s retro clubbing scene where people vibe to the endofasubhere it sounds like the soundtrack to the 8bit or 16bit era of gaming akin to the likes of a mega man or a similar side scroller endofasubhere makes me think of the clubs in 2000s as well as shows from 2000s that were about teenagers or queer life very exciting and it takes me back to better times when i did not have work or responsibilities endofasubhere it reminded me of contra or the old school retro people at the arcades back in the 1990s to early 2000s i could see the main character uses his arm gun and shoot at enemies while they approach i could also see different people at the arcade other types of like pac man and Dance Dance Revolution endofasubhere it was very funky and made me think about cyberpunk themes and places which was very fun to do so from my perspective endofasubhere the put me in mind of an before school endofasubhere i am picturing a busy nightclub which is dark and crowded with the very loud and lots of people dancing etc endofasubhere previous road trip with my friends where they played a with this beat endofasubhere i imagined a entertaining guests at a cocktail party endofasubhere it reminded me of the breath of fire at first mario but it sounded like fire breathing sounds so it lead me away i imagined the turn based combat sort of scene endofasubhere i would expect this more in a especially with the effects like something from an old mario or sonic endofasubhere the sounds like a cartoon endofasubhere yes i envisioned this in a club such as ibiza with a lot of strobe lights and lasers endofasubhere i imagined a dark with a man on stage on dj decks and lots of flashing lights and smoke i imagined a lively crowd and a lot of them were doing finger guns and wearing sunglasses endofasubhere i imagined people dancing and disco lights endofasubhere 
22,concert ,Ele,Ele_MED_19,CONCERT-Ele_MED_19,CON_Ele,sounds like minecraft endofasubhere late at night in my bedroom and i can hear the rain come down and tap my bedroom window endofasubhere sounds like the youd hear in an indie endofasubhere i imagined a track for something taking place on the beach on an overcast blue grey day with cold waters and cold breezes endofasubhere the reminds of shared memories and celebrating new bonds with friends endofasubhere interestinglovingmakes me want to dance endofasubhere i imagined myself at a with the artist getting ready to perform an intimate and the crowd rocking with the tempo as it builds up endofasubhere very fresh in my mind i have attended several functions which have a lot of great memories endofasubhere the has triggered thoughts of my ex girlfriend it is kinda emotional endofasubhere i imagined an instrumentalist performing for a singer the sound before the singer starts endofasubhere people practicing dance moves or a endofasubhere as soon as the drums starts a lady in red starts to dance endofasubhere i imagined myself in my house after a soft working day i would dance to the happily endofasubhere the is on stage his keys while the singer and dancers are waiting for their cue to begin performing endofasubhere the start of the made me feel sad like i was sitting at the side of a fire alone in winter but then the upbeat was fun and sparked some joy and optimism into the evening endofasubhere the scene i imaged would be at a chilled festival in the countryside or woodlands and calmly dancing endofasubhere gave a feeling of calmness no visual scenes endofasubhere its a rainy day i am inside a house with high ceilings a white interior and large windows the overcast light fills the room causing it to be a greyish blue color the rain rolls down the window cue a next scene in which i am driving a white car down a black road that is shimmering with the water from the rain that is drying an aerial shot pans overhead as i drive next to a grassy meadow i am pensively driving like i have big ambitions endofasubhere at the beginning of the i imagined myself at a funeral while it is raining all dressed on black with black umbrellas with other people as the sped up i imagined sitting in a car looking out the window as we drive past the city and start going into a countryside endofasubhere running gravel pavements corners of buildings endofasubhere a karaoke acoustic night endofasubhere at first the vibes were a bit sadder and i could picture raindrops falling against a slab but then it started getting lighter in tone and i could imagine a dj a at a festival endofasubhere the beat was great i wonder what kind of genre this is whos would i hear this at endofasubhere it said for the context but the felt very beautiful and a bit melancholy so i imagined a girl in a long white flowing dress with a wistful expression at first i imagined her on stage doing a performance but then it turned into a fancy interior and then outside in a forest i really liked when the second part came in nice endofasubhere i saw myself near an ocean view listening to a person a and another the drum to begin a endofasubhere i think that this reminded me of a familiar pop that starts off slow and gets upbeat i was thinking of a male singer endofasubhere i pictured myself at a big kind of like a summer festival the crowd is moving to the beat lights flashing everywhere and people are singing along it feels fun a little hyped and everyones having a good time endofasubhere it came to mind as the as the credits are after a endofasubhere rain and a endofasubhere i thought about organising a private for my husband on his birthday endofasubhere this type of gave me the feeling of it being part of a the main character or actor is driving down the road ready to break out into vocals that may signal a sad endofasubhere 
23,concert ,Ele,Ele_MED_20,CONCERT-Ele_MED_20,CON_Ele,feels like you are underwater in the sea very calming very relaxing floating around in water endofasubhere vividly reminds me of a mobile phone ad that i used to get back during covid while watching my favorite streamers endofasubhere this is the kind of background you hear when some big tech company makes some major innovation in the sphere and decides to make a five minute long info dump explaining why this 1000 dollars smartphone is different from the one you just bought endofasubhere i imagined the introduction screen to some kind of underwater endofasubhere it was quite an emotional of endofasubhere it has a nice chill vibe its the kind of that makes you want to relax and maybe daydream a little endofasubhere i imagine the being played on an advert for a product like oil endofasubhere pulsing android ringtone or alarm sound endofasubhere its hard to explain but its like there were colours or colour tiles changing with every note also images of just floating over the colours endofasubhere hot sunny day sun glistening on the sea as birds fly over not a person insight just nature endofasubhere i imagined a man slow motion falling from the sky until the screen fades to black when the stops when it starts again we see him under water slowly sinking to the bottom endofasubhere more of a deep techno track somebody like tiesto in 2004 or something to a large room dark crowd and neon light show slowly building up the to an eventual large grand loud finish endofasubhere its a calm sound and i am a fan of calm sounds it reminds me of my solo moments endofasubhere while i was listening to the i felt some kind of excitement it was like i was getting ready for a big moment on stage with lights endofasubhere i could imagine two people who just got into a serious fight are at their places lying in bed thinking about what they had done as they cry and regret endofasubhere the sounds as if it comes from a endofasubhere loading patience looped endofasubhere slow and soothing in my thoughts endofasubhere is gives off nail salon vibes at a spa and somewhere you want to relax makes you feel at peace and at one with yourself earth very spiritual endofasubhere an astronaut floating in space endofasubhere i imagined a about space filled with futuristic and slow moving scenes endofasubhere sounds like a curtain raising track at a endofasubhere i could tell the prompt was right endofasubhere i imagined this as some sort of weird wellness retreat and this is the they force you to listen to to try and meditate they say its healing but all you can focus on it how it all feels so unattached and unlike one of and then they tell you that is actually how you feel about your life endofasubhere melodic more picturing this for relaxing meditating than a something you would listen to to relax and meditate endofasubhere

25,concert ,Jaz,Jaz_LOW_21,CONCERT-Jaz_LOW_21,CON_Jaz,a but not one in particular endofasubhere i thought about a classic in a everyone is just enjoying the and each others company had to think of a scene in my head because nothing came to me right away endofasubhere for this i imagined a ragtime like scene in black and white with some comedic aspects going on in a nice restaurant similar to the laurel and hardy used to make a very stereotypical waiter with one hand on a silver dish an a french moustache slipping and dropping drinks and food it is also shot very fast paced endofasubhere a busy hotel or a swanky perhaps in a posh hotel maybe during the holidays endofasubhere the spot light is on one of the player and the is now showcasing their skills endofasubhere the instrumentation reminds me of many cartoons i have seen fairly odd parents popped into my head especially endofasubhere i imagined a children like the jungle book with baloo dancing around joyfully with the other characters in an open area of the jungle endofasubhere to me this screams out elevator or an old classical black and white that just has people moving around normally endofasubhere it reminded me of a tv theme like frasier so i imagined i was sitting to watch that show endofasubhere i imagined a very packed with everyone dressed in vintage fashion from the 1920s smoking and drinking and having a good time endofasubhere it makes me think of dancing away in a swing endofasubhere probably used as an funny intermission between different acts to allow people time to do what they need to do before the like performance endofasubhere doctor who season 4 i think with donna and the episode where the doctor is facing the invisible monster than copies his speech pattern in a train the show in the beginning them two in the lobby of the new planet enjoying their vacation and donna says shes heading to the pool and the doctor goes on a solo trip endofasubhere i imagined seeing people the i heard on stage endofasubhere made me think of cooking where you have to rush to complete orders and those little other basic that have basic tasks like making burgers and coffee endofasubhere i thought about the dude on youtube showcasing his different he had a lot to show and this reminded me of his marimba performance i can even hear his voice saying marimba as if i am watching his right now endofasubhere this very much reminds me of tom and jerry classic so i enjoyed it a lot as it gave me nostalgia endofasubhere someone the glockenspiel in a circus area with someone doing tricks and juggling in the arena endofasubhere i imagined a group of clowns performing on the street with xylophones and colorful on a rainy day endofasubhere therapy clinic where i was taking my grandmother endofasubhere i imagined children doing ballet dancing at school endofasubhere since it was kind of a lively it reminded me of the tv show frasier so i imagined the hustle and bustle of the city people walking and rushing around endofasubhere i thought of wacky elevator or designed for kid that have you making things or looking for items endofasubhere i wanted a xylophone as a child i think it would still be cool to have one or to be able to an in general endofasubhere i love the beats it is an endofasubhere i did not imagine a i imagined a upbeat where people were sat at a having drinks endofasubhere reminded me of a children or small toy they can interact with endofasubhere i pictured one person up on the stage the xylophone to a small crowd i struggled to picture a scenario where this would be played at a endofasubhere this sounded like a sound id hear in a kids show endofasubhere a ballet class with kids dancing around in tutus endofasubhere 
26,concert ,Jaz,Jaz_MED_02,CONCERT-Jaz_MED_02,CON_Jaz,when i was a kid spending an afternoon with my grandma doing jigsaw puzzles endofasubhere first thought was the greatest of all time la noir its straight out of a 40s club or a prohibition era speakeasy endofasubhere at first i could imagine a browser window with a cafe ambient and then i could see my universtys starbucks in full view and then i saw the inside of it as though id stepped inside and i was watching students sip their coffees and tap away on their laptops endofasubhere this brings back the memories of my ex partner endofasubhere peaceful and serene endofasubhere i felt like i was in a club there to enjoy the musical artistry of older and more experienced artistes while i relax and reminisce on life endofasubhere this one reminds me of every weekend i thought i was in a church during praise and worship time i always long for sundays so i can hear such cool sounds endofasubhere it sounds like an artist performing in a the artist will likely be an instrumentalist endofasubhere a person on stage singing on a endofasubhere i imagine entering a expensive restaurant endofasubhere i imagined this being played as a dedication during a proposal function endofasubhere a musical their on stage and a crowd slow dancing to the endofasubhere an introduction at a the crowd is beginning to buzz with excitement as the are all making their way to the stage loud cheers are erupting each time one of the members enters the feeling of tension within the crowd as they anticipate the entrance of the is lifting endofasubhere this made me feel like i was either in a with cigarette smoke in the air or listening to this on the banks of the seine in paris past midnight in the middle of summer endofasubhere date night in the city such as london or new york city having wine and dine time with a loved one while listening to some and enjoying the atmosphere endofasubhere its noir roaring 20s i am in a wearing a zoot suit with a cigar in my mouth i see a bombshell of a woman and i begin talking to her shes able to only match my energy but even put me on my toes the more i talk to her the more i begin falling in love its a smoky with dim lighting endofasubhere me and my partner were at a lovely steak restaurant endofasubhere this made me imagine myself like i was in a getting dressed and applying makeup in a large mirror the vanity is messy and there are clothes on the floor endofasubhere showgirls romance new york rain on pavement romance endofasubhere  endofasubhere it reminded me of christmas and michael buble also someone the saxophone while a man is singing passionately and serenading a woman singing with a voice style similar to michael buble i imagined men in suits performing endofasubhere sounds like a symphony i thought about how this is not a i would attend endofasubhere i thought of a theatre setting with an orchestra this specifically a saxophone soloist endofasubhere a love scene two people being affectionate to one another endofasubhere i pictured an outdoor in the middle of a big city during summer i pictured people laying on blankets in grass around the stage endofasubhere i thought about a performance in britain got talent endofasubhere i imagined the thought of being in a whilst this relaxing played in the background endofasubhere 
27,concert ,Jaz,Jaz_MED_07,CONCERT-Jaz_MED_07,CON_Jaz,i imagined myself in a restaurant maybe in the usa rather than the uk a calm evening meal probably at somewhere quite posh endofasubhere in my mind i could see a similar to one you might see in the 1920s there is a couple dancing nearby there is colored woman on stage taking a break from singing the air is filled with both the smell of cigarette smoke body odour endofasubhere it made me feel like i was in a nice cozy nook endofasubhere this gave me a scene in a dim lit nightclub with performers that do not sing and people having side conversations at the well know establishment endofasubhere the bells in the background made me think of christmas reminded me of a nice restaurant in new york at christmas time with someone specifically the scene in la la land where the guy ryan gosling is in that scene endofasubhere i imagined someone a while there are audience listening endofasubhere the sound makes me imagine myself on holiday walking alone and admiring nature and the beauty of a new quite and calm city endofasubhere i get mixed memories of michael buble performing on stage but also a hint of james bond theme which brings back some memories around the but nothing in particular endofasubhere a sleek top floor apartment in new york city with its own maybe the owner is hosting a party endofasubhere totally have felt this vibe at it makes me feel like getting a cocktail and hanging out in the night endofasubhere i pictured a with the lights dimmed the was full of people dressed in suits and fancy dresses sipping cocktails a woman with auburn hair and a green sequin dress was sipping a martini watching the endofasubhere the is a hence the image which came into mind is been at a ball and dancing with a significant otherspending quality time together recreating memories endofasubhere the is melodious and seems to be played during colorful wedding endofasubhere i imagined a quite with a man in the corner endofasubhere it feels like an elegant high class restaurant with like a stage for a performance being from a is not the first thought i would have for this but i can see it a fancy event endofasubhere new orleans cruise etta james endofasubhere reminds me of being in my room with incense lit and chill relaxed whilst i wind down for the evening endofasubhere i was thinking about the moments i was with my family on a vacation it was a happy moment that was relaxing endofasubhere i imagined a man on a stage in a dimly lit room but a light shining on him the stage was red tinted and the man is wearing a suit passionately lost in the he is in the background is a his but they are out of the spotlight yet still somewhat visible the overall vibe is an old timey one from the 1930s or so endofasubhere when am in a romantic date with my wife endofasubhere in a busy train station endofasubhere i thought of noir crime and mystery as well as two television series that used similar matlock the series that aired in the 1980s and 90s and in the heat of the night this sounds like the soundtrack for a mystery or crime drama endofasubhere the musics quality resonated with me on a personal level evoking a specific memory endofasubhere the sound provoked thoughts of a fine dining setting endofasubhere i imagined being in an old school underground with cigar smoke filling the air with a classical at the fore front endofasubhere i imagined a dimly lit fine restaurant or club with people mingling theres a live this on a stage and everyone is wearing black tie attire endofasubhere i imagined myself in an all white party drinking a glass of wine with other people dancing and some sharing stories with laughter endofasubhere its calming and serene endofasubhere pictured myself having a really nice dinner at a fancy restaurant with my partner endofasubhere it made me think of a fancy hotel in a really expensive restaurant as that is the sort of thing it gives off endofasubhere i was thinking that i could easily see the scene where a female singer is on stage and the to the she is about to perform is behind her are her live who are the she herself is standing at her microphone stand nodding to the and ready to come in when it is her cue endofasubhere i thought of a fancy club as the scene it would be played by a small of musicians on a stage in the club surrounded by people dressed very nicely and who look expensive or rich endofasubhere its black and white a detective is sitting at the smoking they are panning around in an opening title sequence he has case files spewed about in front of him hes a regular a glass of whiskey neat sweats next to him as he looks over the crowd endofasubhere felt like that would be at a fancy restaurant endofasubhere classical makes me feel at ease i feel like i am slow dancing with a romantic partner endofasubhere

29,concert ,Met,Met_LOW_14,CONCERT-Met_LOW_14,CON_Met,sounds very dramatic very endofasubhere i imagined chasing someone down some twisting small alleyways endofasubhere another that sounds like boss in a jrpg or an arcade that has a time trial on it like a light gun endofasubhere long haired fans listening to some sort it felt similar to that through the fire and flames endofasubhere the only thing i could think of was a browser window with youtube and or spotify this as a recommended track or as part of a for you mix endofasubhere the relates to a moment of joy dancing and celebrating with friends and family endofasubhere i have attended a lot of shows and with such tunes and it brings a lot of memories endofasubhere i imagined something like a party since the has unpredictable progression and the is lovely to listen to endofasubhere i envisioned a and roll where musical performers took the stage endofasubhere watching a endofasubhere i loved it and thought it was great i can imagine that being played at a and i can imagine that it would be something i would choose to go to i imagined it being semi style but not too deep just the right amount it sounded very action packed and i can imagine lots of people at the sat in rows and the stood on a big stage with lots of lights endofasubhere i can see star with a also with a black hat and tattoo endofasubhere i imagined this being played in tv stations before news highlights are presented endofasubhere i imagine myself and my partner at the just feeling the moment as the endofasubhere i thought of a and roll where a is performing on stage and the crowd is full of energy jumping up and down to the endofasubhere stage lights are flashing and strobing the crowd are getting really into the a small part of the crowd near the front are moshing whilst other dotted throughout the crowd are headbanging endofasubhere i imagined a venue with green strobe lights and flames shooting and a mosh pit endofasubhere someone in a foot chase running amongst the streets and into houses going after someone else it high intensity and quick foot chase endofasubhere the only thing that came to my mind was watching a character from the hero to this the character is wearing a hat has long black hair and is wearing thick platform boots and ripped jeans endofasubhere event endofasubhere it reminded me of anime background i imagined characters fighting in a battle with this in the background i also imagined a japanese and someone strumming a enthusiastically endofasubhere it said so i was expecting classical but it was cool synth type so i imagined bands i like that it reminded me of such as blutengle and depeche mode endofasubhere i imagined a on stage jamming out to the part of a show with the and endofasubhere a scene in the show stranger things the characters are on a mission endofasubhere i pictured being at a packed with a lot of energy in the crowd people are jumping around singing along and just letting loose the whole place feels alive with bright lights and everyone feeding off the bands energy endofasubhere i pictured a symphony in a indoor venue the reminded me of a like final fantasy endofasubhere someone a keytar and close up of a endofasubhere i thought of being in a with my friends and having a lot of fun endofasubhere when listening to this i felt excitement and a bit of a mood rush i wanted to get up and out to the endofasubhere 
30,concert ,Met,Met_MED_19,CONCERT-Met_MED_19,CON_Met,i imagined that i was watching a that has a montage scene like an action comedy one i could not actively imagine being at a like this endofasubhere a heavy gig or festival endofasubhere when i hear this i think of my sister and i as kids listening to like this banging our heads pretending to air our hair would get all crazy but it was always so much fun to have a battle endofasubhere dethklok thunderhorse it is a great endofasubhere this reminded me of a kid that is been getting bull finally getting his revenge on the guys that have been messing with him in a endofasubhere discomfort really did not like iron maiden and acdc came to my head colours red and orange angry endofasubhere i pictured performed live on stage endofasubhere the sounds remind me of action scene where the antagonist is being defeated and was paraded to the people endofasubhere reminded me a bit of listening to the sweet child of mine solo on youtube as it sounds a bit similar endofasubhere a racing where the cars were very fast sport cars endofasubhere i thought about tony hawk downhill on wii it had a soundtrack that was just like this endofasubhere initially i thought of my dad as he is a lead and used to practice in our room but when the harmonising part came in i thought of black veil brides and the emo core scene in belfast there was a really cool alternative shop that was dark and sold t shirts endofasubhere a at a endofasubhere i imagined a hard on stage while a crowd of people had their hands raised in the air endofasubhere this feels right at home in the middle of an ongoing where the audience is enraptured and in the zone and the action and energy keeps going keeps building the pulling it along and leading listeners to anticipate whats coming next endofasubhere black veil brides dragonforce type solos it reminds me of i have seen of the german festival am ring wacken endofasubhere again reminds me of live but also going onto youtube and seeing some live performances of bands that i havent ben able to see in person like jimi hendrix etc endofasubhere i watch wrestling and this makes me feel emotional about some of the main wrestlers entrance endofasubhere i thought of an older such as star fox and this is during a tough climatic mission most likely some sort of boss fight or another hard sequence the would serve to hype up the moment and be a memorable part of the ex endofasubhere again motorbikes came to mind endofasubhere i felt that this would fall into a genre like power symphonic or thrash i was reminded of the called skiltron however i did not conjure up that many visuals in my mind for this of endofasubhere scenes of i have attended with similar genre came to mind endofasubhere at a like yungblud uplifting and energetic at a endofasubhere it reminds endofasubhere this also sounded like the opening scene of an anime endofasubhere it made me think of a scene in a called stranger things when they were trying to kill a monster endofasubhere i could easily imagine this being a punk maybe like fall out boy during an section of their the i was imagining are somewhat close to the edge of the stage with fans equally pressed up against the edge of the stage i was imagining the really into what they were completely lost in the endofasubhere i pictured a scene from a where the crowd is having a great time and forming a mosh pit in front of the stage while the lead from the does their solo endofasubhere my first thoughts were it sounded like an american anime style cartoon bakugan but then it shifted into a hero picture it sounded very clear and like someone was hitting the notes perfectly endofasubhere a a person working out would listen to while using the gym machines and lifting heavy weights while on caffeine endofasubhere 
31,concert ,Met,Met_MED_20,CONCERT-Met_MED_20,CON_Met,i thought about being in a with friends i can see myself looking to my right and left and being in the middle of a huge body of people i can see me and my friends jumping up and down and enjoying the solo endofasubhere one of those white people where the artist a and they go wild but its like a niche thing only known to his fans endofasubhere its a the crowd is one big mass and everyone is surging forward lots of lights and some fire around the stage while the is dancing and endofasubhere this sounded kind of like the last one so it made me think about the same thing someone i used to know that was in love with the kiss part of those memories were not good so this just made me sad again i thought about sitting in the living room and hearing him jamming in his room endofasubhere for this one i imagined hero in some sort of gaming an i was hitting the solo while there was a massive crowd surrounding us for some reason i also imagined an arcade dance floor below us that wasnt being used endofasubhere a teen about superheros this as they save the day endofasubhere this is very fitting for a seems like a rockstar endofasubhere my mind instantly went to avenged sevenfold they were one of my favorite bands growing up and this sounded exactly like something i have heard before the solos really gave me an uplifting mood and made me sit up in my chair i love like this especially while working out or driving in the afternoons endofasubhere the climate of a where everyone is into the endofasubhere i thought of watching with that sound endofasubhere thoughts of the on the stage during the live in an open place endofasubhere i imagined being a passenger in a car on a late night road trip on a hot day with the windows down dancing along and air to the while laughing with the driver feeling carefree and happy endofasubhere i have heard similar played during mostly as special hidden easter eggs you can activate a strange thought indeed endofasubhere it would be a on a large stage many pyrotechnics would also be involved endofasubhere i could imagine someone on stage in front of a crowd being excited endofasubhere i imagined a man dressed in all black with long black hair and dark makeup holding a and it with a lot of passion endofasubhere it makes me imagine someone riding on a horse into battle someone in armor with a big sword endofasubhere this is probably during a high intense scene of the performance with everyone screaming an shouting i imagine headbangers in the crowd and mosh pit everywhere endofasubhere sounds like the opening for a shonen anime endofasubhere anime opening endofasubhere i could see this being used in a 3d sonic the hedgehog oddly enough i also felt myself the and shredding it up right along with the on stage or the studio performing endofasubhere made me think of my emo days growing up when i would listen to bands like black veil brides and other 2010s a fun time when i had a lot of hang outs with friends endofasubhere the double reminded me of hero and that also brought up thoughts of dragon force i imagine trying to get the combo and going through the rhythm of the to get as much points as i can possibly get endofasubhere this felt like a to listen to as i have heard many similar and it was fun to listen to and compare to the past endofasubhere i see a in hair attire riffing in a crowded stadium endofasubhere at a and a performing and the player having a solo endofasubhere i imagined myself as a kid hero it reminded me of real memories i have of that same thing although i do not recognize this endofasubhere my friend who loves this type of endofasubhere my thoughts were when i attended a they always tunes like that endofasubhere seemed like a focused on and pumping up the crowd to follow along and vibe with it endofasubhere i liked that one it had a very cool riff it makes me want to go to a or a festival like glastonbury endofasubhere a on stage the with big like a heavy endofasubhere i pictured this being played at a huge stadium it was very dark and the on stage are shredding their and people were going crazy there were flashing lights and fire effects on the screen behind the stage people were moshing endofasubhere i imagined a making lots of noise on a stage i did not think id enjoy this endofasubhere a made up of teenage white kids in the garage endofasubhere 
32,movie,80s,80s_LOW_02,MOVIE-80s_LOW_02,MOV_80s,sounds like a scene set in a big city where the main character is depressed or wandering the streets at night endofasubhere i could see a camera panning around a raining city somewhere hidden along the street is a where a detective is having a drink hes down on his luck and think the culprit is going to get away but a woman is about to enter the with some important information for him endofasubhere it felt very emotional and swinging towards the sad side maybe the hero in a just got hurt or died endofasubhere this gave me the vibe of an erotic with a romantic scene and mysterious feel endofasubhere reminded me of a cowboy riding his horse over a sand hill into the desert smoking western style endofasubhere sounds like an attached with emotions and passion i would say its appropriate for staged as well endofasubhere i imagined driving home after a stressful day at work and with the thoughts of how life has been unfair with me in areas where i gave in my all and did not get to achieve my goals endofasubhere a beach on a tropical holiday island at night the blue ocean gently splashing against the grey stone wall by the beach path endofasubhere i imagined a trip on a luxury style cruise ship makes me feel regal and elegant endofasubhere a black and white mafia where the protagonist gets told by the woman hes been slowly falling in love with that shes happily married he watches her walk away its bittersweet endofasubhere played at a dinner event endofasubhere the seems to be a background of sorrowful event endofasubhere i imagined watching an old on the couch with my girlfriend endofasubhere yeah this feels like a romantic or a romantic scene in a when the lead characters are dancing intimately and it slows down at the end of the night and they are still holding each other enjoying the moment winding down while focused only on each other or maybe outside of the party afterwards out on the sidewalk in the cool air while the characters ruminate over their experience together and figure out how to say goodbye for the night endofasubhere it sounded like i am wishing on a star and provoked thoughts of hope dreams and persevering for me i thought about my goals and what i want for the future endofasubhere just reminded me of being on a walk i tend to listen to this type of when i need a bit of alone time often when walking so this evokes some pretty strong emotion endofasubhere i was in miami around 2022 live with similar cool vibes made me feel relaxed endofasubhere i am picturing a sad sequence in a perhaps the characters have just had a falling out and one is walking around in the rain through a city as the camera pans around them endofasubhere in a romantic scene endofasubhere relaxing tranquil setting endofasubhere i imagined a large as well as a musician holding a saxophone i am not sure if i heard a saxophone in the though at the beginning of the i imagined gothic architecture such as a gothic mansion with tall iron gates i also envisioned a romantic cafe scene in a city like paris with couples seated together and cups of coffee emitting steam into the air endofasubhere the made me imagine moments from my past that resonated with me endofasubhere it reminds me about me about my dog endofasubhere a romantic date night with my partner saxophonist around dinner that sort of thing endofasubhere i imagined an 80s with a woman walking by herself on a beach at sunset her hands are in her pockets the wind is blowing her hair and she is contemplating life endofasubhere most probably the ending where cast are being mention and other people who were involved in the making of the endofasubhere i imagined a wedding endofasubhere i imagined a romantic scene slow dancing with my partner and having an amazing night out endofasubhere the scene that came to mind was a scene in a where everything had gone wrong for the hero and he is leaning against a wall rain falling down around him wondering when everything started to crumble and how can anything be made right after it all collapsed endofasubhere i thought about a scene in a where someone likely a man would be walking home alone after being rejected by a woman romantically endofasubhere another detective story the detectives partner had just been murdered and he sits alone smoking in a they were friends maybe a bit more than that in another life time he knows he can not work this case but damn it if he wont try everything he can to catch the killer endofasubhere sounded like at a restaurant endofasubhere feels like something you would here at the end of a it belongs during a credit scene in a very relaxing endofasubhere 
33,movie,80s,80s_LOW_06,MOVIE-80s_LOW_06,MOV_80s,i think about an old sitcom this sounds like it would be in the opening it feels like this could be about a familial show where there are many happy moments endofasubhere it sounds like the track of the end credits scene in a happy family everyone is shown to be laughing and having fun whilst the credits roll endofasubhere this made me think of a 90s tv show where they are trying to show each character one by one doing a short scene and with them ending up looking in the camera with a smile or a crazy look something like frasier or cheers endofasubhere i imagined a happy scene in an older for some reason rain man popped in my head and the woman from that was the main protagonist in this visual it shows her in a drinking some type of cocktail and watching a live with the woman wearing a glamourous and sparkly dress endofasubhere ending scene from a 1980s where the two characters get back together and kiss endofasubhere this sounds like an end credit scene from a that could either be a comedy or a romantic comedy endofasubhere this sounded like an introduction to a sitcom such as full house or rosanne my mind instantly went to an image of the screen introducing the characters them doing a silly pose or something and then moving onto the next character endofasubhere two people dancing in each others hands with the world behind them endofasubhere the sound is amazing and i imagined myself dancing with it endofasubhere i thought of being in an office or waiting on hold when i heard it can invoke that in me sometimes endofasubhere the thoughts of the trumpet being played keeps ringing in my mind endofasubhere i imagined a scene at the end of an 80s where the main characters of high school age are all dancing together at a dance with a montage of each character and how their story continued beyond the endofasubhere i get this feeling this would be for an outro of an old school teenagers highlighting different characters with the credits rolling endofasubhere it reminded me of an 80s style so i imagined a sort of romantic sunset like scene with a load of purples and orange hues it was very american 80s too but it also had a grainy look to it endofasubhere i imagined the ending of an 80s maybe a comedy or romance and the screen fades to black to show the credits with this in the background endofasubhere it makes me think of an animated it sounds free and colourful endofasubhere near the end of the where everything went well for all the characters everyone is dancing and happy laughing and joking with each other as everyone all worked at in the end endofasubhere chill endofasubhere scenes of the city a tropical city like miami and or los angeles endofasubhere it made me think of dance from the 80s or the credits to from 90s or 80s the rom comedies and other comedy endofasubhere i had the imagination of the beginning of a sitcom the ones like reba home improvement or even everybody loves raymond i also imagine a studio set with the audience at the back to add to the laugh tracks at the same time i also thought about the beegees just loitering around endofasubhere this reminded me of 90s 2000s sitcoms like family matters and other similar shows endofasubhere a restaurant we visited las weekend endofasubhere mostly the terry perry is what i thought about black americans having a party endofasubhere the sounded like the type you would hear in opening credits to a or tv show or even possibly ending of show to announce character names and titles endofasubhere i thought of a 80s 90s sitcom rather than a i tried to think of a specific one but could not come up with one endofasubhere i imagined a at a as a sort of warm up for the main act where people are mingling and waiting around endofasubhere something i would expect to hear on the radio or when visiting a theme park endofasubhere i imagined the credits rolling at the end of a with this the was giving rom com vibes with a light hearted ending and this gives that impression to me endofasubhere i imagined a wedding party happening and people dancing also i just missed what the attention check asked me to type it said please type the word did not catch the word but i was concentrating endofasubhere i imagined a 90s show with vibrant colors and wild hairstyles endofasubhere 
34,movie,80s,80s_MED_08,MOVIE-80s_MED_08,MOV_80s,sounds like something from a sitcom endofasubhere watching a kids show with my young child and then they start dancing endofasubhere the evokes the feeling of longing in a new place or destination endofasubhere soothinginteresting laughter endofasubhere i felt like i was a character in a and positive things were just happening to me so i was in a good mood or a mood for celebration endofasubhere this one reminds me of my ex boyfriend who loved these types of and also i like watching and i have heard it several times endofasubhere i imagined a celebration kind of like the ones during christmas season endofasubhere it sounds like a used where a family is traveling for a vacation by road endofasubhere i imagined a scene where a person is driving while listening to that endofasubhere i do not know why but this just simply reminded me of a character walking down the street in a that was jolly and happy because of something that has just happened one thing that led to was me thinking about spiderman and how there is a scene where peter parker is walking down the road to the raindrops keep falling on my head and he is happy i imagine that but with this instead like a happy for a happy scene endofasubhere lady in a red vintage ferrari endofasubhere i imagined myself in church because the sound on of the sounds led during the section endofasubhere i imagine a scene where i was at a quiet place trying to find peace within me no one was there just me and endofasubhere i imagined the opening scene of a where an actor is driving in a suburban area enjoying in his or her car endofasubhere a scene in a romantic comedy where the two leads are starting to connect potentially doing something fun or engaging for the first time endofasubhere typically a dance scene in the or when its the end credits and they are showing a reel of what their future lives have turned out to be endofasubhere for some reason i thought of a screensaver i have seen it is artwork of a tropical beach with a pink and orange sunset endofasubhere i do not know why but i am in an ice cream shop the shop sells banana ice cream has a pastel color pallette for its interior the floors are checkered tiles and for some reason they also sell balogna ice cream and have it as a topping they also sell pistachio ice cream endofasubhere end of a comedy series show and the cast are happy and waving goodbye to the crowd camera it is the end of the show endofasubhere dancing sunshine yellow frothy seas sand party young people endofasubhere i feel like i am listening to a michael jackson endofasubhere i thought about bingo parlours as it felt like an older that i mightve heard on the radio back in the 2000s sounded like a 20th century lots of saxophones and vibes endofasubhere it said but it did not sound like a at all to me so i decided to just enjoy the and then i started to randomly imagine banjo kazooie as i feel like it would suit that and i played it a lot with my siblings as a kid on the nintendo 64 endofasubhere i imagine seated behind the car with my parents driving taking me to school on a bright day endofasubhere i was imagining a person happily going about their day in a endofasubhere a scene in a a car pulls into a driveway and a typical suburban family steps out of the car endofasubhere i imagined a stylish scene in a someone walking through a city at night the mixes classical with a modern hip twist making it feel fresh but also a little fancy endofasubhere i pictured it as the introduction to a about a family and the was basically like the family introduction showing each person in it and their name cards sitcom style endofasubhere this gave the imagination of reaching the end of a family an old one and reaching the credits where this is as we see the credits roll up endofasubhere 
35,movie,80s,80s_MED_13,MOVIE-80s_MED_13,MOV_80s,imagine it in a science fiction endofasubhere i imagined the korean i used to binge watch when i was around the age of 14 to 16 i had just gotten back from school and after getting my assignments sorted out my favorite korean show was next in line endofasubhere it sounded like it could be an introduction to some romantic tv show or endofasubhere it sounded quite different and you could hear the voices but not specific words endofasubhere two adult lovebirds dancing over the at a or party endofasubhere my parents being in love back in the days i recently came across a picture of both of them holding hands and the moment the began the picture flashed through my mind endofasubhere it has a gentle acoustic sound with a relaxed feel perfect for unwinding endofasubhere the is on my car radio i am driving from the grocery store and i am enjoying the evening endofasubhere its like i am floating above my thoughts watching them pass like clouds i do not need to solve anything right now just breathe just be this is peace in motion it gives me a meditation vibe endofasubhere opening scene for a twilight endofasubhere the sounded cool more classical or soul endofasubhere it reminded me of the part in a romantic where the couple have a falling out or break up endofasubhere before the fully kicked in i was imagining frozen there was a sound that sounded like a bell ringing and it made me think of the sleigh then after there was a change in i had no thoughts endofasubhere the night sky with shiny stars and moon like something out of a science fiction but with bad effects endofasubhere a fantasy inspired advertisement for a refreshing cold drink endofasubhere i imagined the opening scene of a with slow motion a family of 6 in a park running talking laughing having a picnic lots of cut scenes endofasubhere this made me imagine a rainforest with tribes people with a very peaceful feeling to it i felt happy and relaxed with nature endofasubhere it gives me nostalgic 90s vibes some of it relates to kate bush or bjorks a little bit so it gives me ethereal and angelic vibes but with a hint of 90s 00s downbeat pop in terms of the scenes imagined it matched the visual aspects of the artists mentioned so a more mature older vibe quite serious and romantic endofasubhere it actually gives a church vibe i felt like i was in this church with bright lights streaming through stained glass windows endofasubhere a introduction where they show the production company one that no one has ever heard of or will ever see again as its been set up for this alone and then it runs into the opening scenes of the endofasubhere i could imagine this in a comedy romance where it is a love at first sight endofasubhere the opening title of an 80s probably the view of philly in the sunrise spanning across the city endofasubhere pixies fairies gentle pastel colours sparkle enchantment fantasy endofasubhere a character walking down the streets endofasubhere scenes of a very famous singer at an intimate full of loving fans endofasubhere i could imagine the introduction of a its common to hear such as they state who the producers and actors in the are endofasubhere sounded like a introduction soundtrack endofasubhere an ancient eastern beginning followed by a more progressive path endofasubhere i imagined quite an old set sometime in the 80s i pictured this accompanying those old school intros they use to have introducing all the cast and the producers endofasubhere i could picture this walking into a family restaurant that is friendly and welcoming endofasubhere 
36,movie,Ele,Ele_LOW_09,MOVIE-Ele_LOW_09,MOV_Ele,sounds like a car chase action scene endofasubhere driving a flying car in the future and weaving through traffic endofasubhere it was like a science fiction cyberpunk style space scene building up to some massive fight endofasubhere seemed like an adventure maybe a scene from blade runner endofasubhere the only thing i can think of is a dance night club with everyone a black shadow and bluish white lights flashing about endofasubhere the relates to overcoming struggles it sounds like victory endofasubhere just setting the mood to have a competition or something with a friend or colleagueits like a battle endofasubhere i imagined myself building up energy for a competitive race and the tension was high and for some reason i think i am going to win endofasubhere this one is still fresh in my mind just yesterday i watched a horror and this was the theme tone endofasubhere i imagined an action where someone is being pursued by villains endofasubhere a long drive way in a scene endofasubhere i thought this was great and it just reminded me of john wick or other action where in which the is in the build up to a shoot out or a race where something great and heroic is going to happen loved it made me feel nostalgic and happy endofasubhere a young man running endofasubhere this built tension and sounded like there was going to be an epic drop it made me feel a little bit on edge and aware of my surroundings endofasubhere i pictured an image of an action where heros and fighter are assembling to go for a rescue mission endofasubhere the gave thoughts of an action where it is at its climax endofasubhere an action scene is about to start maybe some sort of chase scene where the protagonist is getting chased by somebody at the start of the the protagonist is realising they are being followed as the continues the protagonist starts running weaving through pedestrians obstacles and traffic as the becomes more intense endofasubhere when hearing this sound it reminded me of a scifi or series where they were racing or battling the bad guys endofasubhere i envisioned keanu reeves i think because similar features in both the matrix and john wick of which he stars in endofasubhere sounds like the beginning of a epic fight endofasubhere somebody was in a cyberspace realm that was glowing blue with lots of digital fractals on the walls they began moving faster as the was building up getting ready to breach the firewall lol endofasubhere detective good guys in deep conversation thinking about a plan then they realise a plan so get to work endofasubhere i imagined someone in black running away from a group of people that are shooting at them the person in black jumps through a window and they start falling in slow motion with the glass falling slowly as well endofasubhere it just sounded like a sound from an action adventure and it made me think of tom cruise endofasubhere watching a endofasubhere i imagined this in the background of a tv show or about racing and the racers are walking onto the track to get into their cars and the camera focuses on each important racer one by one endofasubhere sounds like a that for the credits at the end of a endofasubhere it said so i imagined what type of it would fit as a soundtrack and figured probably action or science fiction but then it also gave me strong vibes so i started picturing that a bit too i have been very interested in terminator lately so i imagined parts of that and the based on it especially the retro ones although it does not fit them exactly endofasubhere i imagined i was watching a of need for speed where cars were racing endofasubhere i thought of some teens or young adult women at a techno with light flashing and people dancing waiting on the beat drop endofasubhere an action with neon lighting people are racing cars down the street endofasubhere i imagined a scene where something big is about to happen the feels suspenseful like everyones waiting for a surprise at the same time the hip beat makes it feel modern and cool endofasubhere felt like a like a battle was about to start with big space marine looking guys endofasubhere i thought about introduction of my favourite series the introduction makes the experience of watching the series unforgettable endofasubhere this gave the feeling of being in an action like a car chase and you are weaving through traffic as stuff is happening all around endofasubhere 
37,movie,Ele,Ele_LOW_14,MOVIE-Ele_LOW_14,MOV_Ele,i was thinking of being at a warehouse project gig with someone old synthy house it felt fun and enjoyable endofasubhere i can see undertale on my computer screen i am fighting sans but the is not quite right i am not running my usual pacifist run so i have to attack him the sounds of my hitting him are satisfying hes going down soon oh no i have just lost so much health to him i have to do this i can do this is all i can think endofasubhere it sounded like retro more than endofasubhere this made me envision a very old fighting one where the graphics arent that good but you could for hours endofasubhere reminded me of the matrix or blade runner someone running down the street in pursuit of something someone technological and modern devices endofasubhere sounds like e prerecorded beats for with more like a dramatic effect mostly played by gen z endofasubhere while listening to the sound i imagined being in a party with strippers and women dancing to a rhythm that was wild and fun endofasubhere an overhead view of a futuristic city at night sped up with vehicle lights zooming along the roads there were also tower blocks with endofasubhere yes if we are talking it made me think of tron has a very similar high tech vibe to it endofasubhere i just thought about old school arcades and 8bit arcade machines it really sounded like space invaders style as you could hear things being fired and hitting objects breaking them endofasubhere i imagined my girlfriends little brother sitting in my living room a endofasubhere oh this feels epic especially with the start it has this sensation of people or characters coming together and approaching a rising conflict or climax things do not feel dire but they are happening and its a powerful anticipatory energy it also sounds like old 8bit or chiptune or something endofasubhere it reminded me of arcade and places you can them such as nq64 in lots of the uks major cities endofasubhere when watching sports reviews especially soccer endofasubhere i imagined this to be the soundtrack to a boss fight in an older Super Nintendo Entertainment System era it made me think of such as zelda or lagoon and i can picture the characters engaging against a mortal enemy as the ramps up the fight is most likely climatic in nature and the stakes are very high endofasubhere it reminded me of from the 90s early 2000s endofasubhere i felt that this could have been pulled from a 1990s side scroller made by nintendo or from a japanese anime from that same era like akira endofasubhere this made me think of super mario and through the levels on my nintendo ds endofasubhere i did not imagine a specific scene per se but i did associate it with the wreck it ralph it reminded me of an animated kids endofasubhere probably a the introduction of a when the characters are being mentioned endofasubhere it sounded very disco 80s themed to me endofasubhere now this sounds more like something from a i imagined pro evolution soccer on a PlayStation 2 with my older brother we absolutely loved that the sound brought a lot of good memories endofasubhere i immediately thought of a high tech futuristic world where the characters in the scene are getting ready to go do something reckless like hack into something the thought that came to mind was that this is something that would maybe at the beginning or middle of the when the characters are still getting up to no good before things get serious at the end of the endofasubhere i thought about an animated geared towards children that was showing some kind of start of an adventure with the main characters endofasubhere is not it that theme from space invaders or something where the planes shoot asteroids i did not love the way it made my head vibrate so it mustve been the asteroids exploding endofasubhere sounded just like arcade endofasubhere it reminded me of retro similar to tetris or pac man endofasubhere 
38,movie,Ele,Ele_MED_19,MOVIE-Ele_MED_19,MOV_Ele,well made quite sad and dynamic maybe a sad scene or something is being revealed doing something important maybe walking in the rain or going to do something you should not be endofasubhere initially imagined it to be a over a sad moment of the however as the beat was added it fit more with a coming of age endofasubhere reminds me of a of my favorite pop musician i imagined my self being engrossed and entertained endofasubhere what popped up in my head right away and all i could think of was minecraft endofasubhere it had a good beat to it and was intriguing endofasubhere a scene from a where one has a thoughtful feeling endofasubhere at first i imagined laying on my bed on a rainy day with a peaceful mind free from worries and the chaos but then when the beats came in i saw myself jump off the bed and back to reality endofasubhere it sounded like it could have been a soundtrack to a scene where someone was getting ready for a big night out endofasubhere i imagine am in the office we are not having a busy day so the supervisor the to keep the morale alive endofasubhere i enjoyed the sound and the thoughts it gave me was to dance to the tunes more of happy thoughts endofasubhere the tune is entertaining endofasubhere beginning of a xxxtentacion or any sad genre endofasubhere classic tunes played in scenes endofasubhere at first i was visualising a horror with low brightness like slenderman then minecraft and the cave i have recently been in then when the clicking sounds began it reminded me of a fashion design dress up i used to so i was visualising that endofasubhere moody scenes of a drone filming over the cliff with the sea early evening like a advert for a new drama programme endofasubhere a lonely cat in the forest after being shooed away endofasubhere i imagined a woman grieving a loved one everything is slow and somber with her crying at the funeral and feeling depressed the then picks up and the scenes become fast paced as the woman deals with grieving drinking crying and the same old routines over and over endofasubhere i imagined i am sitting in my car with a black and mild alone when i hear this because its the type of beats i like when driving and its a old habit i pick up in the slums with black friends and i hear similar with them endofasubhere originally it started to remind me of christopher nolan like inception or vaguely some psychological thrillers like memento perhaps but then it started to provide a beat breakbeat so it lead me more down the road of imagining coming of age school where the main character is making a great development in either the story or their individual role such as finding themselves or walking to an important location such as fish tank for example more indie and british endofasubhere reminds of my adventure time going for a hike endofasubhere i imagined being alone at home and dancing along the rhythms and beats endofasubhere rainy stormy windows in a city apartment a girl feel reenergised and at peace by it endofasubhere i could imagine that it was replaying happy memories of two peoples lives as they held each other with tears streaming down their face endofasubhere the would during the characters scenes endofasubhere a scene where a character dances endofasubhere really peaceful feel to it you can tell its the beginning of a great endofasubhere people slow dancing but as the beats gets more lively the dance becomes faster endofasubhere montage of someone experiencing something sad images of them travelling and looking solemnly out the window very dark ambience endofasubhere that sounded like late 2010s endofasubhere sorry meant to press no had vibes to it like coming of age angst and like the world is moving whilst simultaneously closing and opening up around the protagonist endofasubhere a bleak situation followed by the call to action endofasubhere i could also picture this in an ad or a small shop in the mall endofasubhere very confusing i immediately imagined oh they be dead and its so sad and everyone is at the funeral and mourning then there was this beat that was so entirely unexpected it became they be dead yes but they loved a kick drum endofasubhere 
39,movie,Ele,Ele_MED_20,MOVIE-Ele_MED_20,MOV_Ele,the thoughts about animals swimming came into my head i saw myself in an aquarium and watching a seal and turtle swim around the made me pensive as well as i watched the animals swim around endofasubhere its a scene where something sad has happened and the protagonist is trying to move on very solemn but the background is bright signifying that things will be okay endofasubhere not sure if this is his but i thought about joe satriani my mom used to listen to him a lot on the weekends so i thought about sitting in the living room with my siblings while my mom cleans endofasubhere i imagined a science fiction like city that showed extremely futuristic buildings an a bunch of flying cars zooming past it it looks like a small planet that you can see the circle around from the viewpoint the city is very green and beautiful looking endofasubhere bluish scenery a cyberpunk type view endofasubhere the sounds like a relief maybe from a long that is full of hardships but finally in the end something good and peaceful happens and that is when the endofasubhere this sounded like something i would put on in the morning when trying to relax or read before work i like to listen to the calm your anxiety sounds before work and i hear stuff like this all the time it soothes your brain and gets you relaxed endofasubhere entry scene to a modern city skyline endofasubhere the sound is great and made me imagine sitting all alone somewhere and meditating endofasubhere to me this is like a reflection scene of a character of the or sometimes a sad moment endofasubhere i could imagine a landscape of ruins where the world does not look the same as it did endofasubhere it makes me think of being on a roundabout at the park as a child endofasubhere the made me feel calm like a serious scene just happened in a and now the is so the main characters can reflect on the actions that just happened its a sad scene where they are pondering on how it affected them and are having flashbacks endofasubhere the in question i think would be on the artsier side this sounds like what would be played during a travel montage drone footage of landscapes and following a car also feels cold endofasubhere i thought about being mindful and the serenity and peace that comes from self reflection endofasubhere this reminded me of the playstation loading screen while growing up it had that very meditation like noise i am reminded of waiting for my cousins to finish and the xmen on the playstation 2 at grandmas house endofasubhere i imagined myself floating in a pool with my eyes closed and very relaxed i am the only one in the water at a fancy hotel i feel the warm sun on my face and am at peace endofasubhere i remembered my girlfriend love this beat so much endofasubhere horror when that scary scene appears endofasubhere getting a massage from a masseuse it felt very much like the they rhythmic but calming endofasubhere i was trying to think where the would be used in a i think maybe when the characters are walking by the beach or about to have a heartfelt moment of some sort endofasubhere the is soothing and relaxing in a way endofasubhere i imagined this in a chill out beach in a hot country by the sea people in swimwear and cocktails soaking in a sunset endofasubhere background at a or in some public toilets at a restaurant or cafe endofasubhere this of really felt like it belonged in a i thought it would be used at night time maybe a character is driving or sat in their bedroom or if they have just hung up the phone and are feeling depressed it feels very nocturnal to me endofasubhere i thought this was the kind of you would hear on a plane whilst waiting to take off endofasubhere i imagined a documentary mostly about fun facts or historic information endofasubhere 
40,movie,Jaz,Jaz_LOW_19,MOVIE-Jaz_LOW_19,MOV_Jaz,i thought about a super mario the tune was very similar to the background in most mario it made me think about super mario odyssey which was the last mario that i played endofasubhere those soccer where you are picking your teams and setting up formation before the itself starts endofasubhere an old set in the 20s with people dancing in couples throughout the room its quite lively and fun endofasubhere well i only imagined something from the first part of the because the lower half ruined it first part made me think of going down the pipe in a super mario i thought about collecting all the coins in a level that is really dark and a bit creepy the rest of the ruined it for me though endofasubhere when hearing this i pictured a blues brothersesque in which two cool blues musicians were being introduced and possibly dancing in some sort of fancy it has a zainy feel to it and denotes to me the idea that the is going to be lighthearted family based or comical in nature endofasubhere similar to the last tune my mind shifted halfway into the recording the first part of the recording sounded like a bowser boss fight in the older mario once the kicked in my mind shifted to being in a coffee shop listening to while drinking coffee endofasubhere i thought and imagined myself with friends at a party or ceremonial gathering endofasubhere thoughts of the actor especially when the actor comes out in the streets meeting people and when he is in a good mood endofasubhere at first i imagined a but then my mind switched to an upmarket restaurant lit by candlelight with people in suits and dresses at circular tables watching the with champagne glasses endofasubhere i imagine a scene where in the introduction of a cop you see a cop card going through traffic in a night time scenario endofasubhere i imagined a heist and or a noir setting but a montage of moments as someone is doing a voice over over the top of it endofasubhere i imagined people dressed in vintage fashion from the 1930s swing dancing together at some type of party and having a good time endofasubhere it makes me imagine a 1940s army with people dancing endofasubhere i imagine that it might of been a based on mario as the reminded me of mario so the scene might have been upbeat and fast probably to do with some doing parkour as its a platformer so jumping onto blocks and ledges etc endofasubhere bullshit being a that was fucking mario endofasubhere a guy in the thinking something was wrong and was cautious in approaching and then turns out its all good and friendly and then he mingles with everyone endofasubhere i could picture a man dancing and then people around him the heard endofasubhere my first imagination when the notes hit was pink panther he was cautious in a scene but then suddenly became all jaunty due to the increase of saxophone his back wasnt crouched as before and now he style of walk is very enthusiastic like a cartoon endofasubhere it felt chaotic to listen to and the themes of the seemed to completely switch within that short period i felt a lot of thoughts and emotions endofasubhere at the start it sounded almost like an animated chase scene where people were being chased and it transitioned into almost a club feel endofasubhere i pictured the on a stage in a smaller venue with someone the saxophone in the middle and drums and on each side of them endofasubhere i imagined an introduction to some sort of cartoon that opens on a close up of someones hands the it zooms out to animals dancing in tuxedos its an old school style endofasubhere a certain restaurant which which live endofasubhere a woman in a scene moving across the street in a round skirt seeing a handsome man on the other end endofasubhere the at the start kind of reminded me of a detective coming to a wait is that it that is it sort of realization about a case they have been at a standstill for then it was him working with a renewed enthusiasm endofasubhere seemed at first to suggest like a different theme like possibly suspense but the changes to a lighter positive tone endofasubhere the is played from a drum and some other sound hence the is an endofasubhere i envisioned a scene from a where the actor or actress has recently gone to somewhere like new york and is exploring and is in awe of the city life endofasubhere i can not get over how much the first bit reminds me of mario it threw me off for the rest of the i just kept imagining mario levels and the endofasubhere again i imagined some people having fun after dinner dancing to this in a nice restaurant or even this at a live date endofasubhere a scene where different parts of the city are swiftly displayed one of the scenes was people riding biked by the beach endofasubhere 
41,movie,Jaz,Jaz_LOW_21,MOVIE-Jaz_LOW_21,MOV_Jaz,very peppy like lift again feels busy like you need to do something maybe walking through a shopping center listening to this in the background endofasubhere fun supermarket shopping scene in a coming of age endofasubhere reminds me of a tom jerry show i used to watch the sound track in the background while tom and jerry are being mischievous as usual endofasubhere i thought of a cute little cafe simulator kind of endofasubhere a whimsical sound to it endofasubhere a typical of cartoons or kids shows endofasubhere a circus i remember seeing a circus for the first time the just brought the memories back endofasubhere it sounded like it could have been the soundtrack to a chase scene in a endofasubhere i imagine chilling in my grandmother kitchen drinking tea and listening to her stories while she cooks endofasubhere i imagined the environment of a gambling place likely a cassino with people around busy trying their luck endofasubhere the tune gives a ringtone vibe endofasubhere kids winter wonderland fairy tail endofasubhere the sounds more like the played in kids or mobile endofasubhere it reminded me of one of those mute comedy sketches endofasubhere a child tv show like an animated one that does not actually exist very light blue background for the sky a colourful caterpillar walking buy a house similar to the one in peppa pig occasionally i would visualise someone a glockenspiel with beaters endofasubhere a cute baking with time challenges to finish baking and decorating endofasubhere i imagine i am standing in elevator because this is the only place i would hear it in real life endofasubhere slap stick comedy type of montage of during a perhaps doing some funny events or combining a bunch of scenes into one loft lobby hotel so could be very effective in this scene location as well also gave me feelings of old french or perhaps european non english speaking perhaps still comedy or black and white vintage old ambience endofasubhere reminds me of kids endofasubhere i felt like the tiles and i was fully focused and enjoying the rhythms endofasubhere i could imagine this in a grocery store as a family is walking down an aisle looking for groceries endofasubhere working in an office face paced environment maybe in a endofasubhere 1920s30s tuxedos endofasubhere i imagined like i was in a farm endofasubhere more of an annoying sound one that would be in a kids id say usually at the supermarket or in a elevator but i really dislike it and is overwhelming to the ear endofasubhere a person walking to work in a joyful mood endofasubhere i imagined a xylophone being played i also imagined scenes where people are having fun on a road trip endofasubhere i imagine its more popular in cartoon or animation i could remember all the my daughter and i watch and these kind of sounds are popular endofasubhere that sounded like a soundtrack from a children show endofasubhere sounds like something from when harry met sally or a woody allen so that is what i was thinking of endofasubhere shenanigans occurring at a hotel maybe someone is pulling a prank endofasubhere i could see this being in a maybe one that has a retro feel endofasubhere i pictured this in a quite cutesy designed and i imagined this specific as being in some sort of store that you go into purchase specific items to a region endofasubhere i could picture this in a introduction to a sitcom maybe a silly scene or something like that endofasubhere 
42,movie,Jaz,Jaz_MED_02,MOVIE-Jaz_MED_02,MOV_Jaz,i was thinking of a scene in a christmas where two people are in a posh restaurant endofasubhere a or slow dance in a scene endofasubhere i can see a stage the on the side a curtain slowing raising show a beautifully dressed woman who is about to sing endofasubhere i could imagine myself in a smokey club just enjoying the vibes endofasubhere this seemed like a classic with a gentleman just getting home from work smoking a cigar and taking of his hat endofasubhere i felt like i was in a in new york and the lights were orange and warm and the room was very full of people really warm vibe almost romantic happy but in a cosy way endofasubhere sounded like played in the 70s endofasubhere i imagined a romantic scene with someone i love dearly in a quite place with us walking and holding hands and lots of public display of affection endofasubhere it reminds me of a black and white with a young beautiful actress standing at the turning her head and gazing at someone who she likes endofasubhere sunrise over a hollywood esque town quiet streets orange sky a discarded newspaper sheet blowing around on the ground in an alley endofasubhere i thought of marilyn monroe in black and white leaning on a balcony under the moonlit sky gazing up and sighing endofasubhere i pictured watching a romantic with my best friend also the is a very emotional one if a such as this is been played in a it symbolizes either a scene of love broken hearted or tragedy endofasubhere the seems to be played as a background in a trailer endofasubhere i imagined a woman in an evening gown with her hair pulled back dancing and talking low to a man in a suit endofasubhere this feels like another high class restaurant during the evening but with this feeling of like a character in the has asked someone out to dinner and it is a very adult and professional thing and this as though this scene is like the next step it is not the end or start of a romantic relationship but a transition or something noteworthy and nice a little casual not super tense endofasubhere i imagined being in a cocktail on a date with my girlfriend everyone is sitting and it is a relaxed atmosphere endofasubhere in a wedding the moments made me feel happy endofasubhere i imagined two characters slow dancing at an old timey ball something based between 1900 1940 the characters are well dressed in suits and expensive dresses the two characters that are focused on are there for an ulterior motive such as to spy on someone or to steal an object from the ball and are having a brief bit of fun i am seeing a male and a female with some sexual undertone to their partnership they usually keep it professional but this and dance routine is making it hard for them to do so endofasubhere the in my room with my wife by my side endofasubhere a in the 1930s old hollywood glamour style endofasubhere i was reminded of the soundtrack of the bioshock as well as the of django reinhardt this seemed like the type of that django reinhardt could have made i visualized the underwater city of rapture while listening to this endofasubhere the brought to mind a specific an genre that i enjoy and i found myself picturing the characters endofasubhere this reminded me of the penguin from batman maybe because i have watched all the batman series and played the and this is the sort of that is played when he is being featured on screen endofasubhere made me think of a a romantic date listening to smooth on a weekend evening that sort of vibe endofasubhere i imagined walking down the snowy streets of new york city during christmas time its dark cold quiet and lights and decorations are hung up on the brick townhouses endofasubhere most probably a romance in between the endofasubhere sounds so peaceful endofasubhere i imagined a wedding endofasubhere i pictured the holidays the sound felt very familiar with how we used to celebrate the season we always had cool sounds in the background even when dinner was happening endofasubhere i could imagine this immediately being played in a cheesy hallmark where the woman has moved back to town and has met her former flame the is like an indicator to the viewer that they are starting to get close again while the two reminisce about old times sitting and laughing at an old they used to visit endofasubhere i pictured a scene in a where a couple is sharing a first date in a very nice restaurant the couple are eating dinner and the shot is being captured from outside of the restaurant window endofasubhere someone is on the sidewalk for tips there is a bowler hat on the floor in front of them there are a few people standing around watching them one of which has just thrown some change in the hat and continued walking endofasubhere sounds like played at a or fancy restaurant endofasubhere reminds of a fancy restaurant at night time a romantic evening with this in the background endofasubhere

44,movie,Met,Met_LOW_09,MOVIE-Met_LOW_09,MOV_Met,i thought about being at corp nightclub in sheffield on a saturday night aka my worst nightmare grimy and that i absolutely hate endofasubhere i thought of a superhero but then when the vocals came in my mind went blank endofasubhere our hero has reached a breaking point and plans to kick so major butt someone messed with the wrong person hes packing a bag putting clothes medical supplies weapons anything he may need to take down the big guy before leaving his industrial style apartment and getting on his big motorcycle and driving off endofasubhere this sounded more like a track than the last one it seems like a and mashup endofasubhere i imagined a woman who just got done wrong getting ready to go dish out some revenge endofasubhere reminded me of an iron maiden acdc overwhelmed and too loud endofasubhere i imagine a with characters on the run or fighting with no conversations endofasubhere the sound invokes fear from a scene where action was done in the series breaking bad reminding me of danger endofasubhere it reminded me a bit of when i used to black ops zombies specifically the kino der toten map endofasubhere end credits of an action or a dark superhero endofasubhere it really reminded me of a scene from bill and teds bogus journey where the evil versions of themselves murder the good versions of themselves i think it was because it reminded me of the from the soundtrack endofasubhere an action where there is a fight with the heros and villain endofasubhere sounds like a played on background of a cinema endofasubhere i imagined people headbanging at a endofasubhere it made me think of a fighting scene in a it is quite relaxing and at the same time emotion evoking endofasubhere i imagined i am at an outdoors with hundreds of others the crowd is rowdy and energetic and the is performing with striking visuals and effects endofasubhere in a when i was watching a endofasubhere i imagined a motorbike scene from a the motorbike moving fast paced through a city endofasubhere this sounded like something performed by rob zombie or maybe by maylene and the sons of disaster i did not think of any concrete visual references for this though endofasubhere i wanted to imagine it in an action scene endofasubhere it reminds me of my favourite endofasubhere made me think of indiana jones where they were searching for the treasure sounded like that to me endofasubhere thought of a scene which involves mostly preparations or maybe hunting something endofasubhere i imagined a running scene in a endofasubhere in endofasubhere as the sound played i pictured the entrance of a wwe wrestler with pyrotechnics shooting and a very hyped crowd endofasubhere i was thinking that i could imagine this being used to set the atmosphere for a dramatic confrontation between the main character and the antagonist it feels very much like a villains primary theme endofasubhere i imagined the main character of a dark action getting their weapons and tools ready so they can plot out how to take down their enemy endofasubhere there are monster trucks boxing arenas a skateboard park and a rollercoaster all in the same place endofasubhere fits for a but also something that would be heard at a endofasubhere i thought about edgy like devil may cry or a with people screaming endofasubhere 
45,movie,Met,Met_LOW_14,MOVIE-Met_LOW_14,MOV_Met,a mix of things that should not be together does not sound right or meshed well to me too much going on not sure what part of a it would fit sounded confusing endofasubhere the reminds me of a popular jason statham action i watched a few years ago the main actor being chased by the bad guys or the cops endofasubhere this is what someone puts as the backing for their modern take on mega man in a big fight its like a modernized rom hack endofasubhere i felt and envisioned a suspenseful boss fight in a endofasubhere it was quite fast and uptempo and quite enjoyable you would expect to hear it in a endofasubhere a typical of an action more specially in scenes that involve a chase of some sort endofasubhere it brought a memory where things were in a chaotic mess for me i had just lost my job and i could not think straight back then so i usually hard i thought that could make my worry less endofasubhere it sounded like a energetic with a powerful electric endofasubhere i imagine watching a tv show the before the show begins endofasubhere fight scene from a action endofasubhere the rhythm taps into something under the surface a feeling i can not quite name i am not sad not happy just here just alive in sync with the pulse of the night endofasubhere the tune gives a cinematic experience endofasubhere closing scene to a classic action from the early to mid 90s endofasubhere a specifically a fighting but on the character selection screen endofasubhere someone the someone that looks like jason momoa probably because i have watched of thrones recently then also occasionally some anime scenes endofasubhere the part leading up to the boss battle in a where you take down the minions but they keep coming endofasubhere i imagined a intense chase and fight scene starting off in slow motion with running a man catching up to another man ready to throw a punch and the other man karate kicking him the slow motion stops and the fight intensifies and speeds up when the gets faster endofasubhere i imagined a scene where the protagonist is chasing after the villain endofasubhere felt more like a wait screen something more science fiction and robotic something that is going to suggest shoot em up and police work endofasubhere a boss battle in an old platformer like castlevania quite old endofasubhere gives me like spy vibes usually occurring during a chase or suspenseful scene endofasubhere an evil character making plans to kill someone in a cartoon endofasubhere this sounded like soundtrack from a tense scene endofasubhere a battle between cyberpunk vampires set in japan endofasubhere i could feel this also being one for a similar to sonic endofasubhere this struck me as more than the described but non the less i sort of imagined it as a chase scene or sorts endofasubhere 
46,movie,Met,Met_MED_19,MOVIE-Met_MED_19,MOV_Met,this scene reminded me of one of my favorite wrestlers his theme during his entrance is extremely similar to this i thought about watching him wrestling live with friends and having a great time endofasubhere a with drummers getting lit endofasubhere i thought of a chase scene the protagonist is running through a city and jumping over things whilst being chased by people with weapons endofasubhere i thought about bill ted like when they go on their adventures makes me think about the scene where they are traveling through time this reminded me of from the 90s endofasubhere a scene of a where people are crowd surfing and throwing things onstage endofasubhere like a cool montage but from a cartoon rather than an actual endofasubhere my mind instantly went back to avenged sevenfold from a previous in this study i love this kind of and instantly got me hyped up more i envisioned myself in my car listening to something like this after work and jamming out to the drums especially endofasubhere an intense scene a lot of action either racing running or a fight scene endofasubhere it is a radical sound indicating to my imagination and thought as fighting with someone endofasubhere i thought of i had attended and i tried to envision where the could fit into a other than credits it would have to be a high action part endofasubhere thoughts of the steady full blast eletronic in a live endofasubhere i imagined myself at a large gig in a huge crowd surrounded by like minded people getting lost in the and the atmosphere it put a smile on my face and i could imagine exactly how i would feel in that moment endofasubhere i imagined a like this to be on a montage action packed it has uplifting beats and makes you sorta hyped up endofasubhere i could imagine someone something on a and rifting some keys on a stage in front of a crowd of people endofasubhere i imagined an intense fight scene in a with dragons and people dressed like vikings going to war endofasubhere it makes me think of a samurai sword fight endofasubhere its that scandinavian again i feel this would be played during a heroic rescue scene endofasubhere anime opening n roll endofasubhere i felt a fiery intensity that i normally get when listening to heavy headbanging goodness endofasubhere made me think of being in a with other stars and people who are head banging very fun it has me thinking i want to go to a club and party endofasubhere it reminded me quite closely to the sonic franchise sonic is going all around in loops going so fast while obtaining those golden hoops in different levels and difficulty endofasubhere it felt very like so i was in tune with the thinking a lot about my past party endeavours so therefore it invoked a lot of memories endofasubhere reminds me of bullet for my valentine type that i would listen to as an alternative person or a endofasubhere someone running in a and being chased by the baddie endofasubhere i imagined watching a live stadium show where members that look similar to kiss are performing i was also trying very hard to recall the artist as i know i have heard it before endofasubhere gym endofasubhere my mind went to car race when i am and winning the race endofasubhere i think it would be cool to learn how to the as well but i do not know if its too late to learn now being in a sounds very cool endofasubhere the is relaxing endofasubhere i tried to imagine it as part of a like an action fast chase scene but then i kept imagining a small in a a new endofasubhere something i imagine would be in a when something fun is about to happen endofasubhere i just imagined getting a headache from listening to this kind of its painful to my ears endofasubhere the theme at the beginning of a kid teen show endofasubhere

51,video game,80s,80s_MED_13,VIDEOGAME-80s_MED_13,VID_80s,i thought about a 90s disney it gave me those 90s vibes it reminded me of when i was a kid and when i would watch these with my big sister endofasubhere after i completed the stage any button i press on the controller it makes the sounds i kept hearing endofasubhere a relaxing beach scene clear blue water very sunny and sandy beaches theres no one there just a very tranquil place endofasubhere the beginning of the made me think of a final fantasy just going on an adventure but then i got confused when it turned into some kind of rb endofasubhere even though i can not recall this it gave me great feelings of nostalgia my nintendo 64 when i was younger to me i visualised some type of racing that is set on a beach this is the introduction for the menu screen an it features cool characters that look like they came straight from miami vice or surf culture the cars were sporty and fast endofasubhere vintage scene from with fairy characters endofasubhere this most certainly sounds like its from a i imagine it is from the main menu of the where the user can select the mode they want to endofasubhere the start of a you just click on the initial prompt and now you are at the beginning of the endofasubhere the sound was really interesting and made me feel good endofasubhere very 90s clouds ambient greenery there are several vibes i could get from this sample many interpretations i thought of those all at different parts endofasubhere the thoughts of a especially when you are winning or when a is about to start endofasubhere i imagined a fantasy like labyrinth with mysterious creatures in the scene beautiful scenery and a character going on a journey to discover the mysterious land but also themselves endofasubhere i imagined more of a nintendo like zelda or something made by them and it would be either the title page or near the start of the endofasubhere i could imagine myself and my brother sitting down to a in the evening after school or on the weekend endofasubhere i imagined a big beautiful river with a lot of magical creatures hanging around and swimming inside the river endofasubhere it made me think of when i was younger the is soft and floaty endofasubhere this is probably played after the player has died this is calming with a screen saying continue in bold with a little light flying around maybe to symbolise the players life flying away if it does not agree to continue endofasubhere this is absolutely title screen of some sort endofasubhere i could see this being used in a 2nd of recent memory then i also picture a from the 1980s very soulful endofasubhere it made me think of the back in the older times which would have you do the most basic tasks it was very peaceful and i want to lay down on grass and chill and think of better things in life endofasubhere i thought about michael jackson him on the stage spotlights on him the choir is on the side singing alongside with him crowds of fans on the seats waving their hands and cheering the is at the back endofasubhere this typically reminds me of the old 80s retro so i start thinking about from that generation endofasubhere i did not have a specific image but i was thinking generically of a and the little clicks in the of something being collected endofasubhere i imagined a world similar to that in winx club and there were little creatures with wings flying around smiling and laughing with each others the world is colorful and full of candy endofasubhere it took me back to church choir imagined myself listening to church with congregation endofasubhere it sounded very familiar only until the voices came in then it stopped sounding familiar at first it sounded like the starting screen for a console when it turns on then when the water drops sort of sound happened it reminded me of a i have heard before i do not know which one but something nostalgic endofasubhere at first thought it sounded like a sega perhaps racing or sonic endofasubhere until the vocals came in i though it might be from a nintendo like mario kart but then again maybe the is too calm for that but the vocals confused me a bit endofasubhere the is heart warming endofasubhere on my nintendo wii when i was about 6 years old endofasubhere this sounded like from a kids the introduction of it when its on the home screen endofasubhere was very calm and relaxing reminded me of a place such as a library or dentist where it is very calming endofasubhere i imagined this in a when you have reached an ethereal kind of location that you have been waiting to get to for ages i imagined sparkles in the endofasubhere 
52,video game,Ele,Ele_LOW_09,VIDEOGAME-Ele_LOW_09,VID_Ele,very charged sounds like a i have heard before in an advert about you would not steal a blank feels like its telling you something feels important or like you need to be paying attention endofasubhere gave much more upbeat energy imagining a car racing through the streets at night with neon lights around or a high speed chase endofasubhere reminds me of an introduction on gta back when i had an xbox i imagined turning it on and going on gta while waiting for the whole to load and hearing this in the background endofasubhere dimly lit dance hall bright flashing led lights a dj hyping the people up in the crowd almost a rave air about it endofasubhere first i imagined a space where you fly around in a space ship and then i imagined watching the aliens in the halo looking out the windows of their spaceship endofasubhere expect to hear this in an action adventure science fiction endofasubhere a theme for an adventure endofasubhere i started trying to remember a lot of action i watched in the past and it made me begin to desire more action i think i would watch one tonight endofasubhere the made me think of driving down a dusty road in the desert at sunset endofasubhere i imagine its on saturday evening and our favorite show is about to start endofasubhere i imagine myself fully immersed i a virtual involving combats and adventure endofasubhere the tune is entertaining endofasubhere geometry dash thor ragnorok attack on titan nothing came to mind too naturally but that is what it reminded me of endofasubhere a boss battle with a science fiction tech looking dragon endofasubhere i imagined a hacker trying his hardest to hack into a company to find out something about one of his friends it gets more and more intense as his screen shows a lot of windows and numbers with him trying his best to figure this code out he finally achieves this endofasubhere i imagined i was in a battlefield and battle was happening all around me when i was listening to this like the doom endofasubhere it reminded me heavily of an edm type of drop so for a i was envisioning things like halo or tron legacy but i do not have experience with these so something that follows similar ideas that allows multiplayer shooting or objective based like teams claiming territory but more futuristic 100 futuristic the provides a lot of energy and bounce so aspects of a future generation like advances in technology really add and compliment that effect of the endofasubhere i was totally moved by the energy of the instrumentals it made me feel like i was in a lively outdoor jumping and moving with the crowd under bright lights endofasubhere futuristic cities with flying cars futurama esque at sunset endofasubhere i could imagine an intense fight going on against a huge boss that they hadnt seen before endofasubhere the appears in the fight scenes endofasubhere a like cyberpunk 2077 the kind of that would right before a shoot outfight endofasubhere rave neon bright fun endofasubhere a nice with friends endofasubhere very cool beat very intense and makes you feel like you head is going to pop but in a good way gives the impression that the drop is going to be great as well endofasubhere formula 1 race the cars are lined up to start the race then as the gets faster the cars start racing endofasubhere i imagined people running from enemies i imagined the start of a fight scene in i also imagined scenes from action endofasubhere the transformers came to mind i feel like its the same sound i have heard from the show endofasubhere it sounded like i was watching an action sequence scene endofasubhere sounds like its from that where you had to jump over things on iphone geometry dash that is it gunns redownload that now thanks endofasubhere it sounds like its from a 90s or early 2000s era fighting or shooting and this is the image that came to mind endofasubhere i could see it in a but i could also see it in an arcade that offers laser tag endofasubhere i pictured this as a a racing with the build up to the beat dropping as an introduction to all the characters right before the lights turn green for you to go endofasubhere 
53,video game,Ele,Ele_LOW_14,VIDEOGAME-Ele_LOW_14,VID_Ele,me and my friends mario kart while i am trying to win endofasubhere it sounds like from a 90s or an arcade machine endofasubhere pac man some annoying from the 80s very irritating a sort of pixelated endofasubhere i imagined a pixelated combination scroller moving from left to right like paper mario and fighting like mortal kombat endofasubhere the captures moments of party celebration endofasubhere alive strong care freemind blowing endofasubhere i felt hyper and active it was like i was building up energy to go for or achieve something endofasubhere i envisioned a shooting for two players endofasubhere a gta and minecraft endofasubhere i loved this also and thought it was great it reminded me since it is used in a context that it is some kind of old style 8bit or nintendo 64 sort of like really old space invaders even and just other 8bit style that are pixelated nostalgic endofasubhere i can remember contra the guy with a yellow hair in the endofasubhere this was funky and engaging i was imagining a where i was running away from someone endofasubhere i imagined this being played in a car race it really brought the thought of how the cars move so first and navigate as i such endofasubhere i imagined someone a racing on their system something related to an old racing background endofasubhere a like motor combat where the player is competing with their competitor shooting each other out and covering themselves endofasubhere an 8bit style platform the player has reached the end of the level and is now in a boss fight the player knows the mechanics of the boss fight so is expertly moving around the arena dodging the attacks of the boss and damaging the boss whenever possible endofasubhere this was fun i like techno so this felt quite similar in style it made me feel like i was standing over a balcony of a club watching the debauchery occur endofasubhere a such as pac man in an arcade endofasubhere i thought of tetris initially and then pac man it brought up thoughts experiences of arcade in bowling alleys endofasubhere a retro 8 bit where your goal is to destroy a large alien mothership the bitcrushed explosions being the sound of you damaging the boss endofasubhere a group of nerdy coders thinking hard and trying to create crack a code they are working on their laptops endofasubhere i imagined shapes like rectangles squares from the tetris falling down in total darkness the shapes colours really stood out in the darkness the colours were pink green and blue endofasubhere pac man space invaders arcade tear or rip endofasubhere i imagined characters going through a maze in a it felt very techno and high paced like something was going down in a or a timer was running out to complete a mission endofasubhere i could totally see hearing this in a it felt like i was mario cart again endofasubhere the sounded very retro and style with a action genre type sound to it so i imagined lots of different retro titles that i have enjoyed in the past which was fun i kind of also imagined an amalgamation of retro titles so it was like a cool mash up it brought to mind 8bit type ex endofasubhere i imagined an animated of racing cars endofasubhere i believe i have heard this in a old where you point and shoot at incoming objects endofasubhere arcade screens with like pac man and the spaceship shooter endofasubhere it made me think of a fast paced something with racing or futuristic levels the house beat gives it a really cool energetic vibe like you are moving quick and escaping opponents endofasubhere i pictured an old platform where you are in the middle of a fight running from monsters endofasubhere space invaders but also people dancing endofasubhere i get the feeling of being in a retro maybe something like mario or sonic and collecting coins or battling enemies endofasubhere 
54,video game,Ele,Ele_MED_19,VIDEOGAME-Ele_MED_19,VID_Ele,i thought about a memorial because of the dark beat at the beginning it began to get more upbeat so it made me think more optimistic thoughts endofasubhere those short minutes before the episode starts where they the soundtrack that is what came to mind endofasubhere sounds like a cutscene showing the main character living their everyday life after they have left a covert mission they are just in a nice flat drinking some wine while relaxing endofasubhere this reminded me of that sex scene in cruel intentions between the main characters there was so much emotion in the scene and it was very intimate endofasubhere for this i could imagine an older man with medium length grey hair and glasses pictured in a cafe diner with a hot drink with steam coming out pondering something with serious intent i could image from this the scene zooms out showing him through the window an a wider shot of the city which looks like a gotham new york type of city is displayed it is also raining and dark endofasubhere when a character is deciding to change their ways from negative to positive it sounds somewhat motivational endofasubhere when the first started the first thing that came to my mind was the slow and depressing of a character dying in a once the bass kicked in i was thrown off by that and my mind shifted more towards two people hanging out and the just being used to drown out the conversations they are having endofasubhere the beginning of an adventure everyone gathered together to start the journey endofasubhere the sound made me thought of being with my love partner endofasubhere at first until the percussion other than the kicked in it reminded me of ambient like in fallout or minecraft once it kicked in i was reminded of like hexic endofasubhere thoughts of when the is about start endofasubhere i imagined walking through a forest at night time at first with a crackling fire nearby then the pace of the picked up and i imagined myself walking with more purpose and admiring the night sky endofasubhere i am imaging this to be during a short add about the olympics showing multiple quick different athletes in different sporting environments that they partake in endofasubhere i could picture a guy struggling but preparing himself for the physical challenge he is embarking on endofasubhere this seemed like it would at the end credits of a making the player seem sad that its over probably due to the ending of the being tragic and sad or just being a sad conclusion to the story endofasubhere i think this is one of the disks in minecraft endofasubhere a person slowly gets up to get ready for a battle where he could lose his life the later parts where the beats start is him getting up and slowly walking towards the exit to enter the battle endofasubhere i pictured a random an rpg endofasubhere i am suddenly reminded of the 2010s this type of was popular and i heard it all the time during junior high and high school i can hear it on the television such as americas got talent or the voice endofasubhere gave me images almost like walking through a forest among the trees when its raining endofasubhere i imagined a tranquil landscape in the arctic and then suddenly polar bears appear clapping and stomping along to the endofasubhere imagined myself listening to street singers who perform in the middle of the street endofasubhere i imagined a girl calmly the then a guy coming up and banging a drum next to them maybe trying to disturb her practice the sound of the drums did not really match well with the slow sad endofasubhere sounds maybe like mourning but also pumping up character to go on endofasubhere in a maybe this is the cutscene where the character has really gone through some things and is losing hope until they find it again endofasubhere i love the the beats are hitting differently endofasubhere minecraft as a small child with my friends endofasubhere at first i thought it was a sad scene from a but when the beat started it reminded me of in a beach in a chill out with cocktails and sun endofasubhere on the home page of a whilst navigating endofasubhere i imagined an atmospheric environment in a maybe based in a desolate city in my head this of takes place after a big cinematic event in the endofasubhere sounded like something youd hear in red dead redemption endofasubhere i imagined rihanna performing this in a endofasubhere 
55,video game,Ele,Ele_MED_20,VIDEOGAME-Ele_MED_20,VID_Ele,i could see a loading screen for a an anime girl sitting on a seat in the window knees to her chest its cozy but also futuristic outside the window it seems to be raining above a cityscape we seem to be very high above the ground the clouds are blocking the view downwards endofasubhere i felt a spacey and chill vibe in this endofasubhere this gave me a nostalgic feel of with cousins in an afternoon during summer endofasubhere weird alien vibe kind of imagined a surface of a planet with nothing on it endofasubhere it sounds like a background used in especially when the characters are not having conversations endofasubhere this reminds me of when i am in the cinema before the adverts start and they kind of slow like this endofasubhere a between two participants endofasubhere a phone background that comes when starting the endofasubhere i imagined being on a table at a spa retreat getting a massage endofasubhere since it said this reminds me of a water level maybe deep underwater safe but lonely a bit moody but also gentle it feels like for someone to walk and contemplate to it could also work for deep space but it feels so much like water to me endofasubhere transition at a endofasubhere i felt relaxed and at ease endofasubhere i am imagining myself watching a nature documentary specifically about the ocean i can see fish swimming around and the overall vibe is serene and calm either that or i am a that is ocean themed and this is the main menu endofasubhere calming spa like but with bag pipes west indian style endofasubhere i was reminded of the reverberating echo like background sound found in some by the artist bones like the klebold endofasubhere i found myself picturing scenes characters or environment that fit the theme endofasubhere it reminds me of my old smartphone endofasubhere i imagined a menu home screen on a gaming console in the 2000s the reminded me of the elevator typically heard while on the main menu endofasubhere in a football when selecting players or adjusting the settings endofasubhere it sounds like a trance endofasubhere honestly it brought sad emotions i imagined myself being distant a scene where i was lonely endofasubhere i was thinking of a scene where the main character receives a revelation that shocks them and makes them question their world view in the scene that i imagined they were being told by a benevolent woman about the truth of their situation endofasubhere it sounds like the menu for a that is set in a cyberpunk world i imagine the itself to be very blue hued endofasubhere reminded me of the sound machine testers walmart used to have where you would press button icons and then hear a sound it reminded me of one that would have a water droplet hitting the water but the photo captured it hitting with the ripple effects endofasubhere felt like the transition between at a the volume and slow pace probably contributed to this endofasubhere a relaxing where someone uses it to wind down and get some rest by napping or going to sleep endofasubhere 
56,video game,Jaz,Jaz_LOW_19,VIDEOGAME-Jaz_LOW_19,VID_Jaz,sounds like like something from monsters inc endofasubhere celebrating with friends at a party endofasubhere its almost like two separate of but as two theyd fit into a jrpg like persona or as one it could easily be some nintendo menu endofasubhere at first i thought of a mario bros reboot because the beginning sounded strongly like a sped up yet pitched down from the series endofasubhere the somewhat relates to a childhood i used to with friends endofasubhere it made me tap my feetlike i was literally tapping ma feet and moving my body endofasubhere i pictured the scene to be a dinner setting with a significant other while the musical artistes played their in the background to entertain the audience endofasubhere it sounds like the from a car racing endofasubhere a on my phone with a racing scene endofasubhere in the first part of the i instantly started imagining super mario and the underground theme when you go down a tube and go into the underground however it is played on so slightly different however as the started to progress i started to feel as though the second more funky tunes were related to sims i imagine as a family in sims it is all happy and jolly endofasubhere mario this sounds like the theme for bowser castle but i could be wrong its scary but also fun and jazzy i want to say there are some mushrooms running around too endofasubhere a mario related on a console endofasubhere it made me feel like i was in paris during the middle of the day eating a sandwich at a cafe and hearing a live or central park endofasubhere i am in a main menu character customization menu for a mario kart endofasubhere a man and women arriving at a dance event the dance floor is already filled with dancers endofasubhere this reminded me of the mario super bros on the wii and i am as mario in bowser castle and i am being chased by him and his fireballs endofasubhere tiptoes stairs stealth endofasubhere a salsa event endofasubhere i a lot of so when i heard this along with the context prompt i naturally started to imagine what type of it would suit and what part of the inspired by i have played in the past i found myself imagining a boss battle in a jrpg at first since it sounded dramatic with an edge of danger and action but once the more jazzy part kicked in i felt it might better suit a mini or perhaps a in a town area you can explore and talk to npcs in to get info endofasubhere i imagined a of an animated pinocchio being chased by a police in a city with endofasubhere i thought of super mario bros in the endofasubhere a cat and mouse type of cartoon like tom and jerry endofasubhere the hip made me picture a stylish level the main character moving through colorful streets dancing around endofasubhere sounded like the start to a funky level in a maybe a racing track like mario kart endofasubhere at the beginning i thought of a spider chasing me sounds like the type of you would hear in an anime endofasubhere i thought about together with my friends endofasubhere this gave me the feeling of my character in a going to a or restaurant or diner after a long adventure endofasubhere

60,video game,Met,Met_LOW_09,VIDEOGAME-Met_LOW_09,VID_Met,i thought about hero with friends in my friends garage this made me nostalgic to my junior high days where everything was easy there were no bills and i just spent time with friends doing dumb things endofasubhere the that starts just before an epic boss fight and the boss is revealed and starts hunting down the main character endofasubhere i thought about an avenged sevenfold i thought about being in the crowd and just head banging to their i imagined how the lights were flashing all around me and some fire endofasubhere to me this felt like the old wwe 2015 and earlier where they would have like this on the main menu and cut from famous from real wwe events endofasubhere sounds like it is from a difficult level of a it seems like challenging times sounds endofasubhere end of a race of fight scene when the victor is celebrating the win endofasubhere i thought and felt like being alarmed by the sound endofasubhere this reminded me of the one of my good friends used to listen too sounded a little too hard to be with the vocal there endofasubhere thoughts of a especially at the start where the musician is starting or entering the stage endofasubhere i imagined it as the build up to a fight scene with the main protagonist standing on a dirt track outside a bikers ready to fight as the bikers slowly leave the building looking menacing endofasubhere i imagine this to be near a final boss or an important part in the mostly when the setting is at its most tense endofasubhere i imagined a boss battle type scenario especially because of the typically heard in line it would be in a dark and gritty setting possibly with flames and a high action atmosphere endofasubhere i could imagine it being played at a festival for grunge with someone dressed up in a punk outfit endofasubhere i think of a on stage with a lot of energy performing very intensely with the crowd being very hyped and jumping up and down endofasubhere it made me imagine my console a shooting and running towards flames in the endofasubhere i imagined that i was entering a type of war zone as a super soldier the was there to show me how intense the scene was and was meant to get me hyped up endofasubhere definitively boss fight i see a big grendel type thing endofasubhere an average fight scene in a or a n roll album in an empty room endofasubhere it sounds straight from a like doom the doomslayer is ready to rip and tear into the demonic horde of enemies endofasubhere made me think of where you as main character and kill zombies or other bad creatures reminds me of fighting evil and getting most kills in shooting endofasubhere the made me imagine a little bit of the of devil may cry series it had the feeling of mixed and where you attack the boss with your combo skills and basic attack you get to attack in stylistic movements and weaving through the bosss attacks endofasubhere this evoked negative emotions on me as it reminded me of those thriller horror which caused me a lot of tension in the past endofasubhere that sounded exactly like a hard version of the dr who theme tune so i imagined peter capaldis credits endofasubhere a on a stage more of a heavy endofasubhere i imagined myself being front row at a headbanging there was a mosh pit that formed close behind me when the vocalist screamed endofasubhere michael jackson endofasubhere i imagined a action scene when the star is about to attack endofasubhere i imagined more mini boss like before you face the main boss this is one of the stronger ones you have to beat before you can challenge the main boss endofasubhere i thought of the baby because that is the only i really know though i am fairly sure this is not one of their endofasubhere i imagine this at a heavy with people head banging and going a bit mad endofasubhere navigating through a fighting survival hunting people and people hunting me endofasubhere i imagined not a specific scene but i could see this of being used as the introduction title sequence for a i am not sure what kind of but i could imagine the credits rolling endofasubhere this sounded like something that i would listen to when call of duty zombies endofasubhere i imagined a wrestling show endofasubhere 
61,video game,Met,Met_LOW_14,VIDEOGAME-Met_LOW_14,VID_Met,i was thinking of a scene from pokemon maybe in a battle maybe from an episode i wouldve watched 15 to 20 years ago endofasubhere i can see a big futuristic boss with a well armed character who is flitting around dodging slamming sword attacks whilst managing to get in a few attacks themselves the boss slams down his sword and the character runs up along it to take down the boss endofasubhere i enjoyed what it seemed to be was a mashup of genres endofasubhere i immediately imagine a scenario of a with a police chase during racing and you have got to get away and complete the mission endofasubhere sounds like that can be used in kids endofasubhere the sound reminds me a scene in gta v on a driving mission where i was to deliver some shady package endofasubhere a quick flash of a ninja running across flat rooftops in cloudy daylight endofasubhere easy this one was like castle castlevania reminds me of retro gaming for sure like a old side scroller endofasubhere it took a while but eventually i started imagining a retro 8bit battle scene where the enemys face pops up and says some text like youll never defeat me endofasubhere been played at a wedding ceremony between two couples endofasubhere sounds a played on a background of an action endofasubhere i imagined watching an 80s and people were running from the bad guy endofasubhere yeah this makes me think of boss it feels like you are actively fighting a formidable foe and its a tough fight with a lot of energy endofasubhere sounded like the dragonforce black veil brides track i heard earlier this reminds me of when i was younger and when i used to listen to this kind of endofasubhere i can clearly visualize this being a boss track during a final fantasy the boss would be a secret boss that is uncovered by the player and is an epic climax of some sort the fight would be very challenging and the would be a defining feature of the fight for the fanbase endofasubhere i was reminded of 1990s side scroller including the for the super nintendo entertainment system that featured the power rangers endofasubhere it makes me feel of energy and suspense that i am on a mission and have a mission to complete there is suspense and upbeat action feeling endofasubhere i imagined a final scene in a where the character is racing down a gravity defying track trying to escape the villain it was cartoonish and futuristic but more of a 2000s era endofasubhere most likely when changing the setting for a which mostly is likely to be a car endofasubhere reminds me of a endofasubhere heard in a endofasubhere i immediately thought that this was boss more specifically final boss the scene i imagined was something like persona 3s final boss where you are fighting a massive creature on top of a building i was imagining a turn based system where you are waiting to pick your next move i really clearly could imagine your party waiting on one side facing the monster endofasubhere the sounds like the soundtrack that in a retro styled specifically during a boss fight or another action packed scenario endofasubhere it gave me the same anxiety coconut mall from mario kart gives me it started stressing me out the longer i listened to it but i can not put my finger directly on why endofasubhere sounded like but could also be endofasubhere sounds like the background of a role where you are in an action scene and a mission endofasubhere
