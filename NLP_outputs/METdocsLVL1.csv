38,movie,Ele,Ele_MED_19,MOVIE-Ele_MED_19,MOV_Ele,well quite sad and dynamic maybe a sad or something is being revealed doing something important maybe walking in the rain or going to do something you should not be endofasubhere initially it to be a playing over a sad moment of the however as the beat was added it fit more with a coming of age endofasubhere me of a of my favorite pop musician i my self being engrossed and entertained endofasubhere what popped up in my head right away and all i could of was minecraft endofasubhere it had a good beat to it and was intriguing endofasubhere a from a where one has a thoughtful feeling endofasubhere at first i laying on my bed on a rainy day with a peaceful mind free from worries and the chaos but then when the beats came in i saw myself jump off the bed and back to reality endofasubhere it like it could have been a soundtrack to a where someone was getting ready for a big night out endofasubhere i am in the office we are not having a busy day so the supervisor plays the to keep the morale alive endofasubhere i enjoyed the and the thoughts it gave me was to dance to the tunes more of happy thoughts endofasubhere the tune is entertaining endofasubhere beginning of a xxxtentacion or any sad genre endofasubhere classic tunes played in endofasubhere at first i was a horror with low brightness like slenderman then minecraft and the cave i have recently been playing in then when the clicking began it reminded me of a fashion design dress up i used to play so i was that endofasubhere moody of a drone filming over the cliff with the sea early evening like a advert for a new drama programme endofasubhere a lonely cat in the forest after being shooed away endofasubhere i a woman grieving a loved one everything is slow and somber with her crying at the funeral and feeling depressed the then picks up and the become fast paced as the woman deals with grieving drinking crying and the same old routines over and over endofasubhere i i am sitting in my car with a black and mild alone when i hear this because its the type of beats i like when driving and its a old habit i pick up in the slums with black friends and i hear similar with them endofasubhere originally it started to me of christopher nolan films like inception or vaguely some psychological thrillers like memento perhaps but then it started to provide a beat breakbeat so it lead me more down the road of coming of age school films where the main character is a great development in either the or their individual role such as finding themselves or walking to an important location films such as fish tank for example more indie and british films endofasubhere of my adventure time going for a hike endofasubhere i being alone at home and dancing along the rhythms and beats endofasubhere rainy stormy windows in a city apartment a girl feel reenergised and at peace by it endofasubhere i could that it was replaying happy of two peoples lives as they held each other with tears streaming down their face endofasubhere the would play during the characters endofasubhere a where a character dances endofasubhere really peaceful feel to it you can tell its the beginning of a great endofasubhere people slow dancing but as the beats gets more lively the dance becomes faster endofasubhere montage of someone experiencing something sad of them travelling and looking solemnly out the window very dark ambience endofasubhere that like late 2010s endofasubhere sorry meant to press no had vibes to it like coming of age angst and like the world is moving whilst simultaneously closing and opening up around the protagonist endofasubhere a bleak situation followed by the call to action endofasubhere i could also this in an ad or a small shop in the mall endofasubhere very confusing i immediately oh they be dead and its so sad and everyone is at the funeral and mourning then there was this beat that was so entirely unexpected it became they be dead yes but they loved a kick drum endofasubhere 
39,movie,Ele,Ele_MED_20,MOVIE-Ele_MED_20,MOV_Ele,the thoughts about animals swimming came into my head i saw myself in an aquarium and watching a seal and turtle swim around the me pensive as well as i watched the animals swim around endofasubhere its a where something sad has happened and the protagonist is trying to move on very solemn but the background is bright signifying that things will be okay endofasubhere not sure if this is his but i about joe satriani my mom used to listen to him a lot on the weekends so i about sitting in the living room with my siblings while my mom cleans endofasubhere i a science fiction like city that showed extremely futuristic buildings an a bunch of flying cars zooming past it it looks like a small planet that you can see the circle around from the viewpoint the city is very green and beautiful looking endofasubhere bluish scenery a cyberpunk type view endofasubhere the like a relief maybe from a long that is full of hardships but finally in the end something good and peaceful happens and that is when the plays endofasubhere this like something i would put on in the morning when trying to relax or read before work i like to listen to the calm your anxiety before work and i hear stuff like this all the time it soothes your brain and gets you relaxed endofasubhere entry to a modern city skyline endofasubhere the is great and me sitting all alone somewhere and meditating endofasubhere to me this is like a reflection of a character of the or sometimes a sad moment endofasubhere i could a landscape of ruins where the world does not look the same as it did endofasubhere it me of being on a roundabout at the park as a child endofasubhere the me feel calm like a serious just happened in a and now the is playing so the main characters can reflect on the actions that just happened its a sad where they are pondering on how it affected them and are having flashbacks endofasubhere the in question i would be on the artsier side this like what would be played during a travel montage drone footage of landscapes and following a car also feels cold endofasubhere i about being mindful and the serenity and peace that comes from self reflection endofasubhere this reminded me of the playstation loading screen while growing up it had that very meditation like noise i am reminded of waiting for my cousins to finish and play the xmen games on the playstation 2 at grandmas house endofasubhere i myself floating in a pool with my eyes closed and very relaxed i am the only one in the water at a fancy hotel i feel the warm sun on my face and am at peace endofasubhere i my girlfriend love this beat so much endofasubhere horror when that scary appears endofasubhere getting a massage from a masseuse it felt very much like the they play rhythmic but calming endofasubhere i was trying to where the would be used in a i maybe when the characters are walking by the beach or about to have a heartfelt moment of some sort endofasubhere the is soothing and relaxing in a way endofasubhere i this in a chill out beach in a hot country by the sea people in swimwear and cocktails soaking in a sunset endofasubhere background at a or in some public toilets at a restaurant or cafe endofasubhere this of really felt like it belonged in a i it would be used at night time maybe a character is driving or sat in their bedroom or if they have just hung up the phone and are feeling depressed it feels very nocturnal to me endofasubhere i this was the kind of you would hear on a plane whilst waiting to take off endofasubhere i a documentary mostly about fun facts or historic information endofasubhere
