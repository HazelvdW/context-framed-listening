harmonising,Initially I thought of my dad as he is a lead guitarist and used to practice metal songs in our music room. But when the harmonising guitar part came in I thought of Black Veil Brides and the emo/metalcore scene in Belfast. There was a really cool alternative shop that was dark and sold band tshirts.

restarant,I first thought of a guy playing piano on stage and then a jazz band while people sat in a restarant eating and enjoying the music and atmosphere
nt,"The music sounded like celebration dance music, almost, something with a positive and energetic feeling that also demands attention and feels cool. Since it was stated to be from a video game, I am imagining a cool, competent, suave character coming into action and doing something noteworthy while this music follows them as they lead the scene, maybe causing mayhem but having a good time while doing so. They're winning and things aren't super tense."
noire,"At first, it sounded dramatic and maybe like something from a spy movie. Then more instruments picked up and it intensified the sort of undercover noire spy vibe it had going on. It seems a little odd to play at a bar, but it is very pleasant and feels fancy, like a high class late night dinner party or something, so it is a good vibe to set the mood."
nt,"Oh, this feels epic. Especially with the start, it has this sensation of people or characters coming together and approaching a rising conflict or climax.

scifi,"It feels like action music in a sci-fi setting. The later part of the song, with sounds that almost remind me of engines roaring, can also sound like audience cheers and screams, so that's what ties it into the concert idea for me. There is something or someone with the spotlight and this music is for them while the audience watches."
tv,"This song feels like a rock band I might hear on my parents' TV, or in movies from closer to their time."
videogame,"Since it said videogame, this music reminds me of a water level. Maybe deep underwater, safe but lonely, a bit moody but also gentle. It feels like music for someone to walk and contemplate to. It could also work for deep space, but it feels so much like ""water"" to me."
nt,"This feels like another high class restaurant during the evening, but with this feeling of, like... a character in the film has asked someone out to dinner, and it is a very adult and professional thing, and this song plays as though this scene is like the next step. It isn't the end or start of a romantic relationship, but a transition, or something noteworthy and nice. A little casual, not super tense."
nt,"I thought the song sounded almost sad and contemplative, a weird choice for a bar, but then more instruments kicked in and in addition to feeling sad, it started feeling.... active? Something that is nice to listen to, and gentle, a good beat that catches the ear but isn't too obtrusive as background noise."

mesmerised,i was mesmerised with the music as it gave me good feeling
oldtimey,"I imagined a man on a stage playing piano in a dimly lit room but a light shining on him. The stage was red tinted and the man is wearing a suit passionately, lost in the music he is playing. In the background is a his band, but they are out of the spotlight yet still somewhat visible. The overall vibe is an old-timey one, from the 1930's or so."

snesera,"I imagined this to be the soundtrack to a boss fight in an older SNES-era game. It made me think of games such as Zelda or Lagoon, and I can picture the characters engaging against a mortal enemy as the music ramps up. The fight is most likely climatic in nature, and the stakes are very high."
actionpacked,"I imagined a scene from a video game such as Devil May Cry. The scene is action-packed and the characters are flashy, with anime-style visuals. The moves being performed by the character is almost in sync with the music and there is an emphasis on the ""cool factor"" of what is being seen."

retrothemed,"I'm in a retro-themed bar in a city such as New Orleans and I can hear this song softly in the background amidst the chatter of the customers. The vibe is casual and the people aren't dressed to match the theme of the bar, but the theme is bold enough to not be affected by this."

tv,"This sounds like the main menu theme for a Japanese game. I can imagine myself loading the game, and getting a drink to prepare for my gaming session and this song can be heard from my TV while I'm doing so."
snes,"I'm at my dad's house as kid, and I'm watching him play the old Mario games on the SNES. As the song progressed though, it sounded more modern and more like a remix of an older song, something I would have heard in a new movie themed around an older game."
fanbase,I can clearly visualize this being a boss track during a Final Fantasy game. The boss would be a secret boss that is uncovered by the player and is an epic climax of some sort. The fight would be very challenging and the music would be a defining feature of the fight for the fanbase.
oldtimey,"I imagined two characters slow dancing at an old-timey ball. Something based between 1900-1940. The characters are well dressed, in suits and expensive dresses. The two characters that are focused on are there for an ulterior motive, such as to spy on someone or to steal an object from the ball and are having a brief bit of fun. I'm seeing a male and a female, with some sexual undertone to their partnership. They usually keep it professional but this song and dance routine is making it hard for them to do so."

cafe,"I imagined a large piano, as well as a jazz musician holding a saxophone. (I am not sure if I heard a saxophone in the music, though.) At the beginning of the music clip, I imagined Gothic architecture, such as a Gothic mansion with tall, iron gates. I also envisioned a romantic cafe scene in a city like Paris with couples seated together and cups of coffee emitting steam into the air."
arctica,"I thought of Sonata Arctica, a band that I like. I also briefly thought that this music resembles the music of Rob Zombie, but then I changed my mind. This song gives off ""power metal"" vibes. There is a ""folk metal"" band in Argentina that makes similar music, I believe. I imagined an animated performer with an electric guitar on a stage inside a bar."
mardi,"I felt that this song might be the type of song played at a concert in New Orleans. (I have never heard this song before, as far as I can recall, but one of the instruments made me think of Mardi Gras and New Orleans.)

scifi,I imagined a sci-fi like city that showed extremely futuristic buildings an a bunch of flying cars zooming past it. It looks like a small planet that you can see the circle around from the viewpoint. The city is very green and beautiful looking.
rainman,"I imagined a happy scene in an older movie, for some reason ""Rainman"" popped in my head... and the woman from that was the main protagonist in this visual. It shows her in a bar drinking some type of cocktail and watching a jazz band live, with the woman wearing a glamourous and sparkly dress."
resturant,For this I imagined a rag-time like scene in black and white with some comedic aspects going on (in a nice resturant). Similar to the films Laurel and Hardy used to make. A very stereotypical waiter with one hand on a silver dish an a french moustache slipping and dropping drinks and food. It is also shot VERY fast-paced.

The scene featured ALOT of blue lighting, to make it feel as though the orchestra and sax player are underwater."

Immediately I go back to my early 20s when my friends and I would go to a Dennys at 2 in the morning and hear this kind of music.

nt,"Similar to the last sound that was played, this sounds more like an end-game boss fight in a video game as opposed to something you would hear in a bar.

You can barely see the slightest hint of a cape through the windows.
