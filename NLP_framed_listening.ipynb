The boss would be a secret boss that is uncovered by the player and is an epic climax of some sort. The fight would be very challenging and the music would be a defining feature of the fight for the fanbase.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 744,\n            'f': \"744\",\n        },\n\"19001940\",\n\"I imagined two characters slow dancing at an old-timey ball. Something based between 1900-1940. The characters are well dressed, in suits and expensive dresses. The two characters that are focused on are there for an ulterior motive, such as to spy on someone or to steal an object from the ball and are having a brief bit of fun. I'm seeing a male and a female, with some sexual undertone to their partnership. They usually keep it professional but this song and dance routine is making it hard for them to do so.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 745,\n            'f': \"745\",\n        },\n\"1930s\",\n\"A Jazz bar in the 1930s old hollywood glamour style\"],\n [{\n            'v': 747,\n            'f': \"747\",\n        },\n\"tranqual\",\n\"Relaxing, tranqual setting\"],\n [{\n            'v': 751,\n            'f': \"751\",\n        },\n\"sadromantic\",\n\"It started to sound like something from movie sad/romantic scene but then when the music changed I was unsure of this\"],\n [{\n            'v': 753,\n            'f': \"753\",\n        },\n\"arctica\",\n\"I thought of Sonata Arctica, a band that I like. I also briefly thought that this music resembles the music of Rob Zombie, but then I changed my mind. This song gives off \\\"power metal\\\" vibes. There is a \\\"folk metal\\\" band in Argentina that makes similar music, I believe.

The thought that came to mind was that this is something that would play maybe at the beginning or middle of the movie when the characters are still getting up to no good before things get serious at the end of the movie.\\u00a0\"],\n [{\n            'v': 841,\n            'f': \"841\",\n        },\n\"kpop\",\n\"I really could see this being the extended remix of a really hype song that plays at a K-Pop or J-Pop concert.

The scene I imagined was something like Persona 3's final boss where you are fighting a massive creature on top of a building. I was imagining a turn-based system where you are waiting to pick your next move, I really clearly could imagine your party waiting on one side, facing the monster.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 850,\n            'f': \"850\",\n        },\n\"punkband\",\n\"I could easily imagine this being a punk-band (maybe like Fall Out Boy?) during an instrumental section of their song.

Then it started to almost sound like dubstep and that vision switched to someone making music for the first time and just adding things in that might sound good.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 873,\n            'f': \"873\",\n        },\n\"spewn\",\n\"It's black and white. A detective is sitting at the bar smoking. They are panning around in an opening title sequence. He has case files spewn about in front of him. He's a regular.

I grew up in a family of gamers so this made me think of a scene from like a boss scene in Metroid or the old Doom games, when you just got a power up.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 914,\n            'f': \"914\",\n        },\n\"satriani\",\n\"Not sure if this is his music but I thought about Joe Satriani.
